Three species of wheat namely, Taestivum, Tdurum and T.dicoccum are culti-
vated in the country. Bread wheat is contributing approximately 95 % while
around 4% comes from durum wheat and just about 1% is the share of di-
coccum wheat to the total wheat production. The quality requirements of
wheat for various products like chapati, bread, biscuit and pasta are different
(Table 2). Hard wheat (Taestivum) with strong & extensible gluten and high pro-
tein is required for making good bread. For biscuit, the quality requirements are
soft wheat, low protein and weak & extensible gluten for chapati, we need hard
wheat, medium to high protein and medium & extensible gluten. For pasta
products, hard wheat (Tdurum) with strong gluten, high protein, low yellow
berry incidence and high yellow pigment (B-carotene) content are required.

Minerals although required in very small amounts are very important part of
the metabolism. For populations which are mainly dependent on cereal based
diets or live in the regions where the soils are low in minerals, often suffer
from malnutrition. Nearly 2 billion people around the world are affected by
micronutrient deficiency according to the World Health Organisation.
In view of the above, it is necessary to identify (from the ongoing programme)
& develop product specific varieties for various industrial purposes. Based on
the analysis of AICW&BIP trials, product specific varieties have been identified
(Table 3) for chapati (>8.0 score out of 10.0), bread (>575 ml loaf volume), bis-
cuit (>11.0 spread factor) and pasta (>7.0 score out of 9.0). The chapati quality
in India is among the best in the world but we need improvement in bread &
biscuit quality. Atternpts are in progress to develop such promising varieties by
targeted quality breeding programme and advance lines are being tested in the
national coordinated programme.

India achieved record production of 95.91 million tons during 2013-14 (fourth
estimate) and is the second largest producer of wheat in the world. The produc-
tion is >90 million tons for last few years inspite of several unforeseen adversi-
ties. It shows the resilient nature of Indian wheat programme and this could
be made possible by developing high yielding, disease resistance varieties and
matching production technologies. Wheat is a unique gift of nature to man-
kind as a large number of end-use products such as chapati, bread, biscuit and
pasta etc. can be made from it. The increase in domestic demand of baked and
pasta products along with economic liberalizations and global trade have of-
fered opportunities for better utilization of wheat. The growing demands for
convenience foods such as ready- to- eat, frozen, microwaveable and instant
products has promoted the increase in mechanized food production in larger
commercial plants and the increase in wheat products sold in the supermarkets.
The annual growth rate of the baking industry is projected to be around 5-7%
(Table 1). Hence, wheat quality needs uppermost attention so as to meet the
domestic and export requirements in the time to come.

The issues involved in the improvement of industrial quality are, (i) critical
evaluation of germplasm (both indigenous and exotic) for important quality
parameters along with their genetic and molecular characterization for the
identification of promising parents, (ii) development of product specific wheat
varieties involving identified promising parents & using summer nursery facili-
ties at Lahaul Spiti / Wellington, (iii) development of micro-level tests requiring
small amount of wheat and less analysis time so as to use them in analysing
early generation breeding material, (iv) establishing relationship of end prod-
ucts with different yield and quality components, (v) use of molecular marker
technology approaches for the improvement of wheat quality and (vi) studies
on starch and other components to enhance wheat quality.

The native Indian wheat had been globally recognized for its quality and was
always in demand from overseas clients. During later half of the 19" century, sev-
eral Indian wheat varieties were used as parental lines in many other countries for
improving the grain quality. Between 1888 and 1910, India was in fact exporting
wheat to a large number of countries. The sudden surge in population and two
world wars saw India becoming a food grain deficit nation. The low input, tradi-
tional agriculture, local tall wheat varieties, inadequate irrigation facilities and the
overall stagnant rural economy restricted wheat production at a very low level up
to 1965. By 1970, because of the impact of the green revolution, many visionaries
predicted that India will not only become self-sufficient but will also build ad-
equate buffer to thwart adverse weather and other calamities. This has come true
and India has made great progress in wheat research and development.
