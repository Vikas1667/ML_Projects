Each  potential  investor/debenture  holder  contemplating  purchasing  any \nDebentures\n \nshould  make  its  own \n\nindependent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Issuer, and its own appraisal of the creditworthiness\n \nof the Issuer. \n\nPotential  in\nvestors/debenture  holders  should  consult  their  own  financial,  legal,  tax  and  other  professional  advisors  as  to  the  risks  and \n\ninvestment  considerations  arising  from  an  investment  in  the \nDebentures\n \nand  should  possess  the  appropriate  resources  to  analyse  such\n \n\ninvestment and the suitability of such investment to such debenture holder’s particular circumstances. \n  \n\n \n\nRISK RELATED TO MARKET LINKED DEBENTURES\n  \n\nI.\n \nThe \nDebentures\n \nare subject to model risk i.e. the securities created based on complex mathematical models involving multiple derivative \n\nexposures which may or may not be hedged and the actual behavior of the securities selected for hedging may significantly dif\nfer from \n\nt\nhe returns predicted by the mathematical models. \n  \n\n \n\nII.\n \nThe principal amount is subject to the credit risk of the Issuer whereby the investors may or may not recover all or part of \nthe funds in \n\ncase of default by the Issuer.\n \n\n \n\nIII.\n \nThe calculation as may be provided \n by the Valuation Agent, on the website of the Issuer and that of the Valuation Agent or otherwise, do \n\nnot represent the actual price of the \n Debentures\n \nthat may be received upon sale or redemption of the \n Debentures\n. Instead, such calculation \n\nmerely  represen\nts  the  Valuation  Agent’s  computation  which  may  in  turn  be  based  on  several  assumptions.  The  potential \n\ninvestors/Debenture Holder understand and are aware that the valuation is not in any manner reflective of the actual returns \nthat can be \n\nobtained by subsc\nribing to the \nDebentures\n.\n \n\n \n\nIV.\n \nThe  return  on  an  investment  in  the \nDebentures\n \n(which  are  linked/\n \nbenchmarked  to  securities)  may  differ  from  the  return  an \n\ninvestor/Debenture Holder might earn on a direct investment in the securities over a similar period.\n  \n\n \n\nV.\n \nThe payments to be made to the Debenture Holders will not be fixed, and will instead be linked to an external variable e.g. g\novernment \n\nsecurity price. This could result in variability in payments, because of adverse movement in value of the external variab\nle. The risk of \n\nsuch adverse movement in price/value is not addressed by any rating.\n  \n\n \n\nDISCLAIMER BY THE ISSUER WITH RESPECT TO VALUATION\n: \nThe valuation reflects the independent views of the Valuation \n\nAgent (as defined below). It is expressly stated that th\n e valuation is not the view of the Issuer or its affiliates. The Issuer has not reviewed the \n\nvaluation conducted by the Valuation Agent and is not responsible for the accuracy of such valuations. Further, the valuation\ns provided by \n\nthe Valuation Agent and \nmade available on the website of the Issuer and that of the Valuation Agent do not represent the actual price that \n\nmay be received upon sale or redemption of the \nDebentures \nand the said valuations merely represent the Valuation Agent’s computation of \n\nthe v\naluation which may in turn be based on several assumptions. \n  \n\n \n\nDISCLAIMER BY THE VALUATION AGENT\n: Valuation provided by the Valuation Agent in relation to \nthe Debentures\n \nreflects the \n\nValuation Agent’s opinion on the value of the \n Debentures\n \non the valuation date and does not constitute an audit of the Issuer by the Valuation \n\nAgent. The Valuation is based on the information sought from and/or provided by the Issuer or obtai\n ned by the Valuation Agent from sources \n\nit considers reliable. The Valuation Agent does not guarantee the completeness or accuracy of the information on which the Va\nluation is \n\nbased. The Valuation Agent specifically states that the Valuation is an indicati\nve value of the Debenture on the valuation date and can be \n\ndifferent from the actual realizable value of the \nDebentures\n. The Valuation does not comment on the market price of the \nDebentures\n \nor \n\nsuitability for a particular investor. The Valuation Agent is n\n ot responsible for any errors and especially states that it has no financial liability \n\nto the issuer / users / investors of the Valuation. In the event of early redemption/buy back/ any other premature exit, the \n investors may choose \n\nto contact the Issuer d\nirectly or through their intermediaries (through whom investments in the \n Debentures\n \nwere made) or, in the alternative, \n\nfollow the procedure as set out in this \nShelf Disclosure Document\n. \n \n\n \n\nDISCLAIMER BY THE DISTRIBUTOR/\n \nADVISOR/\n \nINTERMEDIARY\n: It is advised \nthat the Issuer has exercised self\n-\ndue\n-\ndiligence \n\nto  ensure  complete  compliance  of  prescribed  disclosure  norms  in  this \nShelf  Disclosure  Document\n.

Prospective investors should \n\ncarefully consider all the information in this Document, including the risks and uncertainties described below, before \n\nmaking an investment in the Debentures. All of these fact\nors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the \n\nIssuer is not in a position to express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring.\n  \n\n \n\nThe following are some of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materiall\n y from the Company’s \n\nexpectations:\n \n\n \n\nThe following are the risks envisaged by the management of the Company relating to the Company, the Debentures and \n\nthe market in general. Potential investors should carefully consider all the risk factors stated in this \nShelf Disclosure \n\nDocument\n \nand/or  the  relevant \nSupplemental \nDisclosure  Document\n(s)  and/or  the  Private  Placement  Offer  cum \n\nApplication Letter(s) in relation to the Debentures for evaluating the Company and its business and the Debentures \n\nbefore making any in\nvestment decision relating to the Debentures. The Company believes that the factors described \n\nbelow represents the principal risks inherent in investing in the Debentures but does not represent that the statements \n\nbelow regarding the risks of holding the D\nebentures are exhaustive. \nThe ordering of the risk  factors is intended to \n\nfacilitate ease of reading and reference \nand \ndoes not in any manner indicate the importance of one risk factor over \n\nanother\n.  Potential  Investors  should  also  read  the  detailed  information  set  out  elsewhere  in  this \nShelf  Disclosure \n\nDocument\n \nand  in  the  relevant \nSupplemental \nDisclosure  Document\n(s)  and/\n \nor  the  Private  Placement  Offer  cum \n\nApplication Letter(s) and reach their own vi\n ews prior to making any investment decision. Each of the risk factors set out \n\nin this \nShelf Disclosure Document\n \nshall, \nipso facto\n, without the requirement of any further act, deed or reference by the \n\nCompany, unless specifically further modified/updated in\n  \nthe \nSupplemental \nDisclosure Document\n, \nmutatis mutandis \nbe \n\ndeemed to apply to and be repeated in each \nSupplemental \nDisclosure Document\n, issued by the Company in relation to \n\nany Tranche/Series of the Debentures.\n \n\n \n\nIf any one of the following stated \nrisks actually occurs, the Company’s business, financial conditions and results of \n\noperations could suffer and, therefore, the value of the Company’s Debentures could decline and/or the Company’s \n\nability  to  meet  its  obligations  in  respect  of  the  Debentures\n \ncould  be  affected.  More  than  one  risk  factor  may  have \n\nsimultaneous effect with regard to the Debentures such that the effect of a particular risk factor may not be predictable. \n\nIn addition, more than one risk factor may have a compounding effect which may\n  \nnot be predictable. No prediction can \n\nbe  made  as  to  the  effect  that  any  combination  of  risk  factors  may  have  on  the  value  of  the  Debentures  and/or  the \n\nCompany’s ability to meet its obligations in respect of the Debentures.\n  \n\n \n\nThese risks and uncertainties a\nre not the only issues that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not \n\npresently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also have a material \n\nadverse  effect  on  its  financial  condition  or business.  Unl\ness  specified  or  quantified  in  the  relevant  risk  factors,  the \n\nCompany is not in a position to quantify the financial or other implications of any risk mentioned herein below.\n  \n\n \n\nA.\n \nINTERNAL RISK FACTORS\n \n\n \n\nRisks relating to \nthe\n \nCompany and its Business\n \n\n \n \n\n1.\n \nOur business requires substantial capital, and any disruption in funding sources would have a material adverse \n\neffect on our liquidity and financial condition.\n  \n\n \n\nOur liquidity and ongoing profitability are, in large part, depende\nnt upon our timely access to cost effective sources of \n\nfunding. Our funding requirements historically have been met through a combination of borrowings such as working \n\ncapital limits, term loans, short term revolving loans, etc.. \n  \n\n \n\nOur ability to raise fun\n ds, on acceptable terms and at competitive rates, continues to depend on various factors including \n\nour credit ratings, financial performance & growth prospects of our Company, the macro economic factors including \n\nregulatory environment and policy initiativ\nes in India, developments in the international markets affecting the Indian \n\neconomy, investors’ and/or lenders’ perception of demand for securities of \nasset reconstruction companies (“\nARCs\n”)\n. \n\nOur business depends and will continue to depend on our ability \n to access diversified low\n-\ncost funding sources.\n \n\n \n\n2.\n \nOur inability to obtain, renew or maintain our statutory and regulatory permits and approvals required to operate \n\nour business may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nShelf Disclosure Document\n  \n \n\n15\n \n\n We require certain statutory and/or regulatory permits and approvals for our business. \n ARCs \nin India are subject to strict \n\nregulations and supervision by the RBI. In addition to the numerous conditions required for the registration as a\nn\n \nARC \n\nwith the RBI, \nwe are required to maintain certain statutory and regulatory permits and approvals for our business. In the \n\nfuture, we \nmay\n \nbe required to renew such permits and approvals and obtain new permits and approvals for any proposed \n\noperations. There can be no \n assurance that the relevant authorities will issue any of such permits or approvals in a timely \n\nmanner or at all, and/or on favourable terms and conditions. Failure by us to comply with the terms and conditions to \n\nwhich such permits or approvals are subjec\nt, and/or to renew, maintain or obtain the required permits or approvals may \n\nresult in the interruption of our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition \n\nand results of operations.\n \n\n \n\nB.\n \nRISKS RELATING TO THE DEBENTUR\nES\n \n\n \n\n1.\n \nYou may not be able to recover, on a timely basis or at all, the full value of the outstanding amounts and/or the \n\ninterest accrued thereon in connection with the NCDs. \n  \n\n \n\nOur  ability  to  pay  interest  accrued\n/redemption  premium\n \non  the  NCDs  and/or  the  prin\ncipal  amount  outstanding  in \n\nconnection therewith would be subject to various factors \ninter\n-\nalia\n \nincluding our financial condition, profitability and \n\nthe general economic conditions in India and in the global financial markets. We cannot assure you that we \nwould be \n\nable to repay the principal amount outstanding on the NCDs and/or the interest accrued\n /redemption premium\n \nthereon in \n\na timely manner or at all. \n \n\n \n\n2.\n \nAny downgrading in credit rating of our NCDs may affect the value of NCDs and thus our ability to \n raise further \n\ndebts.\n \n\n \n\nThe rating of the NCDs by \n the \nRating Agency and/or agencies indicates high degree of safety regarding timely servicing \n\nof financial obligations and carrying very low credit risk. \nHowever, these\n \nratings provided by \nthe \nRating Agency\n(ie\ns) \n\nmay  be  suspended,  withdrawn  or  revised  at  any  time  by  the  assigning  rating  agency  and  should  be  evaluated \n\nindependently of any other rating. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and investors \n\nshould take their own decis\nions. \n \n\n \n\nAny adverse revisions of our credit rating may adversely impact our ability to raise additional financing, the interest \n\nrates and other commercial terms at which such additional financing is available. This could have a material adverse \n\neffect on o\nur business and financial performance and our ability to obtain financing for lending operations.\n  \n\n \n \n\n3.\n \nThere \nmay be \nno active market for the NCDs on the capital markets segment of the Stock Exchanges. As a result, \n\nthe liquidity and market prices of the NCDs m\n ay fail to develop and may accordingly be adversely affected.\n  \n\n \n\nThere can be no assurance that an active market for the NCDs will develop. If an active market for the NCDs fails to \n\ndevelop or be sustained, the liquidity and market prices of the NCDs may \n be adversely affected. The market price of the \n\nNCDs would depend on various factors inter alia including (i) the interest rate on similar securities available in the \n\nmarket and the general interest rate scenario in the country, (ii) the market price of our\n  \nequity shares, (iii) the market for \n\nlisted debt securities, (iv) general economic conditions, and (v) our financial performance, growth prospects and results \n\nof operations. The aforementioned factors may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of \n the NCDs, which may \n\ntrade at a discount to the price at which you purchase the NCDs and/or be relatively illiquid.\n  \n\n \n\n4.\n \nOur Company may raise further borrowings and charge its assets subject to receipt of necessary consents.\n  \n\n \n\nOur Company may, subject to receip\nt of all necessary consents, raise further borrowings and charge its assets. Our \n\nCompany will decide the nature of security that may be provided for future borrowings. In the event a \n pari passu\n \ncharge \n\nwith other charge holder(s) \nis created, it \nmay reduce the amounts recoverable by the NCD holders upon our Company’s \n\nbankruptcy, winding\n-\nup or liquidation.\n \n\n \n\n5.\n \nSecurity maybe insufficient to redeem the Debentures\n  \n\n \n\nThe Debentures are proposed to be secured by the assets described \nunder th\ne section titled\n \n‘\nIssue Details\n’\n. In the event \n\nthat the Issuer is unable to meet its payment and other obligations towards potential investors under the terms of the \n\nDebentures, the Debenture Trustee may enforce the \nSecurity\n \nin the manner \nmore particularly\n \nset out \nunder the \nrelevant \n\nS\necurity \nD\nocument\n. The potential investors’ recovery in relation to the Debentures will be \ninter alia\n \nsubject to: (i) the \n\nmarket value of the \nSecurity\n; and (ii) finding a willing buyer for the \nSecurity \nat a price sufficient to repay the amounts \n\ndue and payable to the potential investors’ amounts outstanding under the Debentures.\n   \n\n \n\n \nShelf Disclosure Document\n  \n \n\n16\n \n\n  \n\n6.\n \nIssuer’s indebtedness and covenants imposed by its financing arrangements \n may restrict its ability to conduct its \n\nbusiness or operations\n \n\n \n\nIssuer’s financing arrangements require it to maintain certain security cover for some of its borrowings. Should there be \n\nany  breach  of  financial  or  other  covenants  of  any  financing  arrangemen\nts  and  such  breach  continues  beyond  the \n\nstipulated cure period (if any), the Issuer may be subjected to various consequences as a result of such default including \n\nforced repayment of such borrowings. Further, under some of the financing arrangements, the I\n ssuer is required to inform \n\n/ obtain prior approval of the lenders / debenture holders / debenture trustee for various actions.

Any slowdown in economic growth in India could adversely affect us, including our ability to grow our loan \n\nportfolio, the quality of our assets, and our ability to implement our strategy.\n  \n\n \n\nA\nny slowdown in the growth or negative growth of sectors where we have a relatively higher exposure could adversely \n\nimpact  our  performance.  Any  such  slowdown,  and  in  particular  the  financing  requirement  of  our  customers  could \n\nadversely affect our business, \nprospects, results of operations and financial condition.\n  \n\n \n\n2.\n \nPolitical  instability  or  changes  in  Government  of  India  could  adversely  affect  economic  conditions  in  India \n\ngenerally, and consequently, our business in particular.\n  \n\n \n\nThe Government of India has tra\n ditionally exercised and continues to exercise a significant influence over many aspects \n\nof  the  economy.  Since  1991,  successive  governments  have  pursued  policies  of  economic  and  financial  sector \n\nliberalisation and deregulation and encouraged infrastructure\n \nprojects. There can be no assurance that these liberalised \n\npolicies will continue in the future as well. A significant change in Government’s policies in the future could affect \n\nbusiness and economic conditions in India. This could also adversely affect o\n ur business, prospects, results of operations \n\nand financial condition. \n \n\n \n\n3.\n \nAny downgrading of India’s sovereign rating by an international rating agency(ies) may affect our business and \n\nour liquidity to a great extent.\n \n\n \n\nAny adverse revision to India’s credit rating for domestic and international debt by international rating agencies may \n\nadversely impact our ability to raise additional finances at favourable interest rates and other commercial terms. This \n\ncould have an adv\nerse effect on our growth, financial performance and our operations. Instances of corruption in India  \n\n \n\n \nShelf Disclosure Document\n  \n \n\n18\n \n\n have the potential to discourage investors and derail the growth prospects of the Indian economy. Corruption creates \n\neconomic  and  regulatory  uncertainty  a\nnd  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  profitability  and  results  of \n\noperations.  The  Indian  economy  has  had  sustained  periods  of  high  inflation.  Should  inflation  continue  to  increase \n\nsharply, our profitability and results of operations may be adve\nrsely impacted. High rates of inflation in India could \n\nincrease our employee costs which could have an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations. \n  \n\n \n\n4.\n \nImpact of spread of COVID\n-\n19 virus \n \n\n \n\nThe spread of the COVID\n-\n19 virus has affected milli\nons across the globe and the same coupled with measures taken by \n\nthe governments including lockdowns/ curfew has not only affected day to day lives of people but has also given a hard \n\nblow  to  the  supply  chain  of  factories,  with  trade  routes  being  disturbed\n \nand  slowing  down  of  the  industry,  trade, \n\ncommerce and business activities across all sectors.\n  \n\n \n \n\nThe COVID\n-\n19 virus pandemic\n \nis adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, \n\nbusiness,  liquidity  and  cashflows,  and\n \nwe \nhave  experienced  and  expect  to  continue  to  experience  unpredictable \n\nreductions\n \nin demand for certain of our products and services. \n  \n\n \n \n\nHowever, the extent of negative financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but a sustained economic \n\nslow\ndown may significantly affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, cashflows and results of operations and \n\nthe  same  will  depend  on  future  developments,  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  be  predicted,  including  new \n\ninformation which may emerge \nconcerning the severity of the COVID\n-\n19 virus and the actions to contain the COVID\n-\n\n19 virus or treat its impact, among others. Consequently, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s ability to \n\nservice the obligations in relation to the Debentures.\n  \n\n \n\nE.\n \nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESS\n  \n\n \n\n1.\n \nNature of the \nassets\n; \ncredit, market, liquidity, concentration and interest rate risk\n, including \nrisk \narising from \n\nuncertainty of future cash flows and no assured rate of return\n  \n\n \n\nThe Company will invest in \nfinancial \nassets\n, which shall either be:\n \n\n \n\n(a)\n \nNPAs and \nspecial mention account \n–\n \n2 (“\nSMA\n-\n2\n”)\n \nassets, which have been classified as such in accordance \n\nwith guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time in this regard; or\n  \n\n \n\n(b)\n \nstandard assets, whi\nch are permitted to be sold to an \nasset reconstruction company \n/ \nsecuritisation company \n\npursuant to the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India to \n banks \nand \nfinancial institutions \nin this regard \n\nfrom time to time.\n \n\n \n\nThe \nassets \nare subject to credit, \noperational, legal, liquidity, market, concentration and interest rate risk. Credit risk is \n\nthe risk of loss that may occur from the failure of any party to abide by the terms and conditions of any financial contract,\n  \n\nprincipally  the  failure  to  make  the  re\nquired  payments.  After  the  acquisition  of  the \nassets\n, \nthe  Issuer\n \nwould  aim  to \n\nimplement a resolution strategy. This might entail cash realisation from the \nassets \nover a period of time. The value of \n\nthe \nSecurity Receipt\ns \nand the quantum and timing of the ca\nsh flows to the \nSecurity Receipt \nholders \nwould depend on \n\nthe success of such plans. Further, to enable recovery, the plans may be partially or substantially or completely modified. \n\nAlso, there is a possibility that these plans may not ultimately be viable.\n \nThe modifications in the plans would impact \n\nboth the quantum and the timing of the cash flows and hence the value of the \nSecurity Receipt\ns\n. The inherent nature of \n\nthe \nassets \nincreases  the  uncertainty  in  the  implementation  of  the  resolution  plans  in  respec\nt  of  the \nassets \nand  the \n\nrealisation of cash flows from such plans.\n \n\n \n\nIn certain circumstances, it is possible that the investors in \nSecurity Receipt\ns \nwill not recover their original investment. \n\nDefaults and losses on the \nassets \nwill reduce the amount that w\nould otherwise have been available for distribution and \n\nthe redemption of the \nSecurity Receipt\ns\n.\n \n\n \n\nFurther, the value of the \n Security Receipt\ns \ncan appreciate or depreciate depending on the factors and forces affecting the \n\nfinancial markets and macro\n-\neconomic conditions. The various factors which impact the market value of the \nassets \n\ninclude, but are not limited to, fluctuations in the bond market\ns, fluctuations in interest rates, prevailing political and \n\neconomic environments, changes in government policy, tax laws, liquidity of the underlying assets, settlement periods \n\nand  trading volumes.  The  market  value  of  the \nassets \nwill  generally fluctuate  d\nepending  on,  inter  alia,  the  financial \n\ncondition of each \nborrower\n.\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nShelf Disclosure Document\n  \n \n\n19\n \n\n The Company\'s investment in illiquid \nfinancial \nassets \n(being inherent to the non\n-\nperforming and stressed nature of the \n\nsame) may restrict its ability to dispose of investments in a timely \n fashion and for a fair price.\n \n\n \n\nThe \nSecurity  Receipt\ns \nissued  by  the  Company  are  subject  to  market  risks  and  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the \n\nCompany’s objectives will be achieved.\n \n\n \n\nAs in all close\n-\nended schemes, the \nSecurity Receipt\ns \nof the scheme may be infrequently traded. The \nSecurity Receipt\ns \n\nwill be owned by a relatively small number of investors, being \n qualified buy\ners, and no assurance can be given that any \n\nsecondary market for the \nSecurity Receipt\ns \nwill develop. Also\n,\n \nthe trans\nfer of \nSecurity Receipt\ns \nis restricted to \nqualified \n\nbuyers\n.  Purchasers  of \nSecurity  Receipt\ns \nmay  find  it  difficult  or  uneconomical  to  liquidate  their  investment  at  any \n\nparticular time. As a result, a purchaser of the \n Security Receipt\ns \nmust be prepared to ho\n ld the \nSecurity Receipt\ns \nuntil the \n\nfinal maturity of the \nSecurity Receipt\ns\n.\n \n\n \n\n2.\n \nAverage \nlife and redemption considerations\n \n\n \n\nThe \nassets \nhave been acquired keeping in mind a realisation/ reconstruction/ resolution plan. These plans have projected, \n\nfor every \nasset\n’\ns\n \nlikely realisable cash flows and likely periods of realisation (which in no case exceeds the period \n\nspecified in this regard un\nder the SARFAESI). These cash flows have been \ndiscount\ned to present value at appropriate \n\ndiscount rates to arrive at the acquisition price. The expected returns have been indicated keeping in view these plans \n\nand discount rates. The distribution of returns\n \nand redemption of \nSecurity Receipt\ns \nis dependent on these plans. These \n\nplans  may  be  partially  or  substantially  or  completely  modified,  during  the  course  of  the  reconstruction  activities \n\nundertaken by the \nIssuer\n. Also\n,\n \nthese measures and plans may ultimate\nly prove to be unviable.\n \n\n \n\n3.\n \nTax \nissues\n \n\n \n\nInterest income received by the Company from the \n borrower \nmay be subject to deduction of tax at source. All \n prospective \n\ninvestors\n \nare advised to consult their tax advisors and/or obtain suitable professional advice pri\nor to investing in the \n\nSecurity Receipt\ns \nissued by the scheme.\n \n\n \n\nThe taxes, if any, owed by the Company will be paid before any expenses are paid or any distributions or redemptions \n\nare made and as a result, the Company’s ability to pay distributions or redemptions may be impaired. The Company or \n\nthe \nassignors \nwill not \nbe obliged to pay any additional amounts, if the distributions in respect of the \nSecurity Receipt\ns \n\nare subject to withholding taxes in accordance with the \n company deed\n.\n \n\n \n\n4.\n \nCompany’s \nexperience \nin asset reconstruction \n \n\n \n\nThe past experience of the Company in \na\nsset reconstruction / securitisation activities \nmay not necessarily guarantee \n\nachievement\n \nof the objectives of the Company.\n \n\n \n\n5.\n \nChanges in \nlaw \nand \nregulations\n \n\n \n\nThis scheme is subject to changes in Indian law as well as to changes in regulations and governmental policies, income \n\ntax \nlaws\n \nand accounting principles. There is no assurance that the laws and regulations governing asset reconstruction \n\ncompanies will not\n \nchange in the future or that such change will not adversely affect this transaction, the Company or \n\nthe rights of the \nSecurity Receipt \nholders\n. Recovery of asset is also dependent on court processes in India and will be \n\nsubject to the constraints in those\n \nprocesses.\n \n\n \n\n6.\n \nAccess to \ncapital markets and commercial borrowings\n \n\n \n\nWith  the  growth of  its  business,  the  Company  will  increasingly  rely on  funding  from  the  debt  capital  markets  and \n\ncommercial \nborrowings\n. The Company’s growth will depend on its continued ability to access funds at competitive rates \n\nwhich in \nturn\n \nwill depend\n \non various factors including its ability to maintain its credit ratings. If the Company is unable \n\nto access funds at an effective cost that is comparable to or lower than its competitors, the Company may not be able to \n\nhave adequate funds to meet the requ\nirements of the business. This may adversely impact its business results and its \n\nfuture financial performance.\n \n\n \n\n7.\n \nOperational\n \nand \nsystem risk\n \n\n \n\nThe \nCompany\n \nfaces  operational  and  system  risks,  which  may  arise  as  a  result  of  various  factors,  viz.,  improper \n\nauth\nori\ns\nations\n,  failure  of  employees  to  adhere  to  approved  procedures,  inappropriate  documentation,  failure  in \n\nmaintenance\n \nof proper policies, frauds, inadequate training and employee errors. Further, there can also be a security  \n\n \n\n \nShelf Disclosure Document\n  \n \n\n20\n \n\n risk  in  terms  of  handling  info\nrmation  technology  related  products  such  as  system  failures,  information  system \n\ndisruptions, communication systems failure which involves certain risks like data loss, breach of confidentiality and \n\nadverse effect on business continuity and network security\n .\n \n\n \n\nIf any of the systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if other shortcomings or failures in internal processes or \n\nsystems are to arise, this could affect the Company’s operations and/or result in financial loss, disruption of Company’s \n\nbusines\nses, regulatory intervention and/or damage to its reputation. In addition, the Company’s \nability\n \nto  conduct \n\nbusiness may be adversely impacted by a disruption (i) in the infrastructure that supports its businesses and (ii) in the \n\nlocalities in which it is \nlocated.\n \n\n \n\n8.\n \nAny inability of the Company to attract or retain talented professionals may impact its business operations\n  \n\n \n\nThe business in which the Company operates is very competitive and ability to attract and retain quality talent impacts \n\nthe successful implementation of growth plans. The Company may lose many business opportunities and business \n would\n \n\nsuffer if such requir\ned manpower is not available on time. The inability of the Company to replace manpower in a \n\nsatisfactory and timely manner may adversely affect its business and future financial performance.\n  \n\n \n\n9.\n \nEmployee \nmisconduct\n \n\n \n\nAny\n \nkind of employee misconduct may impair \nthe Company’s ability to service its clients. It is not always possible \nto\n \n\ndeter  employee  misconduct  and  the  precautions  the  Company  takes  to  detect  and  prevent  this  activity  may  not  be \n\neffective in all cases.\n \n\n \n\n10.\n \nDowngrading in credit rating\n \n\n \n\nCARE\n \nRatings \nLimited has assigned “CARE \nPP\n-\nMLD \nAA stable” rating for \nthis\n \nI\nssue of Rs. \n100,00,00,000/\n-\n \n(\nRupees \n\nOne Hundred Crore\n \nonly)\n. The Company can\n \nnot guarantee that this rating will not be downgraded. In the event of \n\ndeterioration in the financial health of the Company, there is a possibility that the Rating Agency may downgrade the \n\nrating of the \nDebentures\n. In such cases, investors may have to take\n \nlosses on re\n-\nvaluation of their investment or make \n\nprovisions towards sub\n-\nstandard/non\n-\nperforming investment as per their usual norms. Such a downgrade in the credit \n\nrating may lower the value of the Debentures and/or the Company’s ability to meet its obl\nigations in respect of the \n\nDebentures could be affected.\n \n\n \n\n11.\n \nDecisions may be made on behalf of all Debenture Holders that may be adverse to the interest of individual \n\nDebenture Holders\n \n\n \n\nThe terms of the Debentures contain provisions for calling meetings of D\n ebenture Holders to consider matters affecting \n\ntheir\n \ninterests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Debenture Holders including Debenture \n\nHolders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting.\n  \n\n \n\n12.\n \nCompany’s indebtedness and \n covenants imposed by its financing arrangements may restrict its ability to conduct \n\nits business or operations\n \n\n \n\nThe Company’s financing arrangements require it to maintain certain security cover for some of its borrowings. Should \n\nthere be any breach of fin\n ancial or other covenants of any financing arrangements and such breach continues beyond the \n\nstipulated cure period, the Company may be subjected to various consequences as a result of such default including \n\nforced repayment of such borrowings. Further, un\nder some of the financing arrangements, the Company is required to \n\ninform/obtain  prior  approval  of  the  lenders/\n \ndebenture\n \nholders/  debenture  trustee  for  various  actions.  This  may \n\nrestrict/delay some of the actions/initiatives of the Company from time to ti\n me.\n \n\n \n\n13.\n \nThe Debentures may be illiquid\n \n\n \n\nThe Company intends to list  the Debentures on the WDM segment of the BSE. The Company cannot provide any \n\nguarantee that the Debentures will be frequently traded on the Stock Exchange and that there would be any market f\nor \n\nthe Debentures. It is not possible to predict if and to what extent a secondary market may develop for the Debentures or \n\nat what price the Debentures will trade in the secondary market or whether such market will be liquid or illiquid. The \n\nfact that the\n \nDebentures may be so listed or quoted or admitted to trading does not necessarily lead to greater liquidity \n\nthan if they were not so listed or quoted or admitted to trading.\n  \n\n \n\nThe Company may, but is not obliged to, at any time purchase the Debentures at a\n ny price in the market or by tender or \n\nprivate agreement. Any Debentures so purchased may be resold or surrendered for cancellation. The more limited \nthe\n  \n\n \n\n \nShelf Disclosure Document\n  \n \n\n21\n \n\n secondary market is, the more difficult it may be for holders of the Debentures to realise value for t\n he Debentures prior \n\nto settlement of the Debentures.\n \n\n \n\nFurther, the Company may not be able to issue any further Debentures, in case of any disruptions in the securities market.\n  \n\n \n\n14.\n \nMaterial changes in regulations to which the Company is subject\n  \n\n \n\nAsset reconst\nruction companies (\n“\nARCs\n”\n) in India are subject to detailed supervision and regulation by the RBI. In \n\naddition, the Company is generally subject to changes in Indian law, as well as to changes in regulations and policies \n\nand  accounting \nprinciples.  Any  changes  in  the  regulatory  framework  affecting  ARCs  could  adversely  affect  the \n\nprofitability of the Company or its future financial performance by requiring a restructuring of its activities, increasing \n\ncosts or otherwise.\n \n\n \n\n15.\n \nPolitical instability or changes in the government could delay further liberalization of the Indian economy and \n\nadversely affect economic conditions in India generally\n  \n\n \n\nIf there was to be any slowdown in the economic liberalization, or a reversal of steps \nalready taken, it could have an \n\nadverse\n \neffect on the Company’s business. \nfinancial \ndifficulties and other problems in certain financial institutions in \n\nIndia could cause the Company’s business to suffer. The Company is exposed to the risks of the Indian f\n inancial system, \n\nwhich in turn may be affected by financial difficulties, trends and other problems faced by certain Indian financial \n\ninstitutions. The problems faced by such Indian financial institutions and any instability in or difficulties faced by the\n \n\nIndian financial system generally could create an adverse market perception about Indian financial institutions, banks, \n\nNBFCs and ARCs.

Company \nAditya  Birla  ARC Limited  (the Company) was  incorporated as  a  public limited  company under  the \nprovisions of the Companies Act, 2013 on March 10, 2017.  \n \nThe  principal  activity  of  the  Company  is  to  carry  on  the  business  of  securitization  and  asset \nreconstruction as defined in section 2 of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and \nEnforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (‘the SARFAESI Act’). The Company acts as a Manager / \nTrustee for trusts set up for securitization pursuant to the SARFAESI Act. The financial assets are acquired \n under separate trusts set up for securitization or directly for asset reconstruction. \nReserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) granted a Certificate of Registration to the Company on 13 March 2018 to \ncarry on business of securitization or asset reconstruction under section 3 of the SARFAESI Act. \nThe Company recognises its income through Trusteeship and Management Fees, which is recognized on \n accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective trust deed / offer document / commitment \n agreement, wherever applicable.  \nThe financial statements were authorized for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 21, \n2022. \n  \n2.\n \nBasis of preparation of Financial Statements \nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting \nStandards  (Ind  AS)  notified  under  the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards)  Rules,  2015  (as \namended from time to time). \n \nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and accrual basis except for fair \nvalue through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) instruments, derivative financial instruments, other \n financial assets held for trading and financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit \n or loss (FVTPL), all of which have been measured at fair value. The financial statements are presented in \n Indian Rupees (INR) and all values are rounded to the nearest lakhs, except when otherwise indicated. \n \n \n3.\n \nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IND AS requires the management to make \njudgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets \nand liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Although \nthese  estimates  are  based  on  the  management’s  best  knowledge  of  current  events  and  actions, \nuncertainly about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material \nadjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. \n \n4.\n \nPresentation of Financial Estimates\n  \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. They are only \noffset and reported net when, in addition to having an unconditional legally enforceable right to offset \nthe recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event, the parties also intend to settle on \n a net basis in all of the following circumstances: \n-The normal course of business. \n-The event of default. \n-The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and/or its counterparties. Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n5.\n \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \n \n5.1\n \nRevenue from contract with customer  \n \nRevenue (other than for those items to which Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments are applicable) is \nmeasured at transaction price i.e. the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be \nentitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer, excluding amounts \ncollected on behalf of third parties. The Company consider the terms of the contract and its customary \nbusiness practices to determine the transaction price.  \n \nWhere  the  consideration  promised  is  variable,  the  Company  excludes  the  estimates  of  variable \nconsideration that are constrained. Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines a single \n comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.  \n \nThe Company recognises revenue from the following sources:  \n \na. The fee income comprises of Trusteeship and Management Fee. The Company receives management \n fee from trusts declared by it for acquisition of financial assets and the same is accounted for on accrual \n basis as per terms of the relevant trust deeds and offer document issued by the Trust. Management fees \n are calculated and charged as a percentage of the Net Assets Value (NAV) at the lower end of the range \n of the NAV specified by the Credit Rating Agency.  \nb. Redemption incentive and recovery incentive is accounted over the period on cash basis, i.e. as and \nwhen received by the Company, based on terms of the relevant trust deeds and offer document issued \nby the Trust.  \nc. Any upside share in excess realisation over acquisition price of financial asset by trust is recognised at \n point in time basis as per terms of the relevant trust deed/offer document.  \nd. The above receipts are recognised as revenue excluding GST. \n \nRental Income \nTemporary arrangements were made to give unoccupied workstations to other businesses, rent were \ncharged for the period on these workstations on basis of area wise cost allocation. \n \nInterest Income \nThe Company calculates interest income by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial \nassets other than credit-impaired assets.   \nWhen a financial asset becomes credit-impaired and is, therefore, regarded as ‘Stage 3’, the Company \ncalculates interest income by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost of the \nfinancial asset. If the financial assets cures and is no longer credit-impaired, the Company reverts to \ncalculating interest income on a gross basis. \nFor interest income on Fixed Deposit, the Company recognizes it on accrual basis. \nFor purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, the Company calculates interest \nincome by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortised cost of the asset. \nThe credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the estimated future \ncash flows (including credit losses) to the amortised cost of the POCI assets. Interest income on all \ntrading assets and financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at FVTPL is recognised using the \n contractual interest rate in net gain on fair value changes. Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n \n5.2\n \nFinancial Instruments:  \nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial \nliability or equity instrument of another entity. \nFinancial Assets  \n \nDate of Recognition \nFinancial assets and liabilities, debt securities, deposits and borrowings are initially recognised on the \ntrade date, i.e., the date that the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the \ninstrument \nInitial Measurement \nThe classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual terms and \nthe business model for managing the instruments. Financial instruments are initially measured at their \nfair value, except in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at FVTPL, transaction \ncosts are added to, or subtracted from, this amount. Trade receivables are measured at the transaction \nprice. \n \nMeasurement categories of financial assets and liabilities \nThe Company classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets \nand the asset’s contractual terms, measured either: \n \n-\n \nAt amortised cost \n-\n \nAt fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) \n-\n \nAt fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) \n \nDebt instruments at amortised cost\n  \nA ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: \na.\n \nThe asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual \ncash flows, and \nb.\n \nContractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of \nprincipal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. \n \nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the \neffective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or \npremium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is \nincluded in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the \n profit or loss. \nDebt instrument at FVTOCI\n \nA ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: \na.\n \nThe objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the \n financial assets, and \nb.\n \nThe asset’s contractual cash flows represent Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI). \n Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting \n date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). \nHowever, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange \n gain or loss in the Statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss \npreviously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to Statement of profit and loss. Interest \nearned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method. \nDebt instrument at FVTPL\n \nFVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria \n for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. \nIn addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised \ncost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or \neliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’). Debt \ninstruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised \nin the Statement of profit and loss. \nDe-Recognition of Financial Assets \nThe Company de-recognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the \nasset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of \nownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all \nthe  risks and rewards of ownership  and  continues to  control the  transferred asset,  the Company \nrecognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If \n the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, \n the Company continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises an associated liability. \nOn de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount \n and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been \n recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit and loss if \nsuch gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on disposal of that financial \nassets.  \nOn derecognition of a financial asset other than in it’s entirety (e.g. when the Company retains an option \n to repurchase part of a transferred asset), the Company allocates the previous carrying amount of the \nfinancials asset between the part it continues to recognise under continuing involvement, and the part \nis no longer recognises on the basis of relative fair values of those parts on the date of transfer. The \ndifference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognised and the sum \nof consideration received for the part no longer recognised and and any cumulative gain or loss allocated \n to it that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss if such gain \n or loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on  disposal  in profit or loss if such gain \nor loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on disposal of that financial asset. A \ncumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is allocated between \nthe part that continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the \nrelative fair values of those parts. \nImpairment of Financial Assets (ECL Policy) \nIn accordance with IND AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement \n and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets & credit risk exposure. \n \nThe Company assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) \nsuch as loans and advances held at amortised cost for impairment based on evidence or information \nthat is available without undue cost or effort. Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n \nThe Company applies a three-stage approach to measuring expected credit losses (ECLs) for financial \nassets. \n  \nStage 1: 12-months ECL \nAll exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition or \nthat has low credit risk at the reporting date and that are not credit impaired upon origination are \nclassified under this stage. The Company has assessed that all loans and advances with no default or \nupto 30 days default would fall under this category.  \nFor these assets, 12-month ECL are recognized and interest revenue is calculated on the gross carrying \namount of the asset (that is, without deduction for credit allowance). \n \nStage 2: Lifetime ECL – Significant increase in credit risk \nLifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected \nlife of a financial asset. Financial instruments that have had a significant increase in credit risk since initial \n recognition are classified under this stage. 30 Days Past Due is considered as significant increase in credit \n risk and classified under this category. For these assets, lifetime ECL are recognized, but interest revenue \n is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset less ECL already provided. \n \nStage 3: Lifetime ECL – Credit Impaired \nAll exposures assessed as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on \nthe estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred are classified in this stage. For exposures \nthat have become credit impaired, a lifetime ECL is recognised and interest revenue is calculated by \napplying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (net of provision) rather than the gross carrying \n amount. \n \nCredit-impaired financial assets: \nAt each reporting date, the company assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost is credit \n impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when a breach of contract such as a default or past due \nevent that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have \noccurred. \n \nECL provisioning is being done on each reporting date basis probability of default and loss given default \non outstanding financial asset. \n \nTrade Receivables \nTrade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from \ntransactions that are within the scope of IND AS 115 are recognized. The Company provides 0.4% ECL \non prudential basis on Standard Assets. \n  \nOther Financial Assets \nOther financial assets are tested for impairment based on significant change in credit risk since initial \nrecognition and impairment is measured based on probability of default over the lifetime when there is \n significant increase in credit risk. The Company provides 0.4% ECL on prudential basis on Standard \nAssets. \n \nFinancial Liabilities \nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit \nor loss, debt securities and subordinated liabilities, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized \ninitially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable \ntransaction  costs.  The  Company’s  financial  liabilities  include  trade  and  other  payables,  loans  and Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nborrowings  including  bank  overdrafts.  The  measurement  of  financial  liabilities  depends  on  their \nclassification, as described below:  \n \nFinancial liabilities at fair- value through profit or loss: \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and  \nfinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.  \n \nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated \nas such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IND AS 109 are satisfied.  \n \nFor liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is \nrecognized in OCI.  \nThese gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. However, the Company may transfer the \ncumulative gain or loss within equity. \n \nAll other changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The \nCompany has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss. \n \nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments \nFinancial instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in \naccordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability \n and an equity instrument. \n \nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after \ndeducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company entity are recognized at the \nproceeds received, net of direct issue costs. \n \nLoans & Borrowings \nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized \n cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the liabilities are \nderecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.  \nAmortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or \ncosts that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the \nstatement of profit and loss \n \nDe-recognition of financial liabilities \nA  financial  liability  shall  be  de-recognized  when,  and  only  when,  it  is  extinguished  i.e.  when  the \nobligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires. \n \n5.3\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term \ninvestments with an original maturity of three months or less which are subject to an insignificant risk \nof changes in value. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist \nof cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are \nconsidered an integral part of the Company’s cash management. \n \n5.4\n \nExpenses incurred by the Company on behalf of the Trust Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nExpenses incurred at pre-acquisition stage are recognized as expenses for the period in which such costs \n are incurred. If such expenses are contracted to be recovered from the Trust, the same are shown as \nLoan & Advances to Trust in the Balance Sheet. These expenses are reimbursed to the Company in terms \n of provisions of relevant Trust Deed and Offer Document of the Trusts. \n \n5.5\n \nProperty, Plant & Equipment. \nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates \nless  accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses,  if  any.  Such  cost  includes  purchase  price, \nborrowing cost and any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its working condition for its \nintended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and arrangements arising from exchange rate \nvariations attributable to the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or \nrecognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits \nassociated with the item will flow the entity and the cost can be measured reliably. Depreciation on \nproperty, plant and equipment is provided using straight line method. Depreciation is provided based \non useful life of the assets as prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.  \nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment are \nreviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Gains or losses arising \nfrom derecognition of a property, plant and equipment are measured as the difference between the net \n disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit \nand Loss when the asset is derecognised. \n \nDepreciation on Tangible Fixed Assets is provided on Straight Line using the rates arrived at based on \nthe  useful  lives  as  specified  in  the  Schedule  II  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013  or  estimated  by  the \nmanagement. The Company has used the following useful life to provide depreciation on its fixed assets, \n which is in line with the useful life suggested by Schedule III. \nAsset \n Useful Life as Prescribed by Schedule II of the \nCompanies  Act, 2013 \nComputers (end user computers, Laptops)  3 \nOffice Equipment  5 \nFurniture & Fixtures  10 \nMotor Vehicles  6 \n \nUseful life of assets estimated by management supported by the Internal Technical assessment. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n*In case of Leasehold Improvements, Depreciation calculated based on lease period \n^ In case of Motor Vehicles, depreciation calculated on basis of its replacement. \n \nDepreciation on the Fixed Assets added/disposed off/discarded during the year is provided on pro-rata \nbasis with reference to the date of addition/disposal/discarding. \n \n5.6\n \n Fair Value Measurement \n\nAsset \n Estimated Useful Life\n \nLeasehold Improvements *  3 \nMotor Vehicles^  4-5 Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nThe Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is the \nprice that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \nbetween market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the \npresumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the \nprincipal market for the asset or the liability; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most \nadvantageous market for the asset or liability, the principal or the most advantageous market must be \naccessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions \nthat market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants \n act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account \n a market participant\'s ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best \nuse or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.  \n \nThe  Company  uses valuation  techniques  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances  and  for  which \nsufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and \n minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. \n \nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are \ncategorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is \nsignificant to the fair value measurement as a whole: \nLevel-1- Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \nLevel-2-  Valuation techniques for  which the  lowest level  input that is significant to the  fair value \nmeasurement is directly or indirectly observable \nLevel-3-  Valuation techniques for  which the  lowest level  input that is significant to the  fair value \nmeasurement is unobservable. \n \n5.7\n \nImpairment of Non-Financial Assets \nThe Company assesses, at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be \nimpaired. If any such indication exists or when annual impairment testing for any asset is required, the \nCompany estimates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an \nassets fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an \nindividual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflow that is largely independent of those from \n other assets or Company of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable \namount, the asset is considered impaired and is written-down to it recoverable amount. \n \n5.8\n \nRetirement and Other Employee Benefits \nEmployee benefits are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees \n of the Company, as detailed below: \n \nDefined contribution plan (Provident fund) \nIn accordance with Indian law, eligible employees receive benefits from provident fund, which is a \ndefined contribution plan. Both the employee and employer make monthly contributions to the plan, \neach equal to a specified percentage of employee\'s basic salary. The Company has no further obligations \n under the plan beyond its monthly contributions. The Company does not have any legal or constructive \nobligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee \nbenefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Obligation for contributions to \nthe plan is recognized as an employee benefit expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss when \nincurred. Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n \n \nDefined Benefit Plans (Gratuity) \nIn  accordance  with  applicable  Indian  laws,  the  Company  provides  for  gratuity,  a  defined  benefit \nretirement plan (the Gratuity Plan) covering eligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum \npayment to vested employees, at retirement or termination of employment, an amount based on the \nrespective employee\'s last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company.  \nThe Company\'s net obligation in respect of the gratuity plan is calculated by estimating the amount of \nfuture benefits that the employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior \nperiods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognized past service cost \nand the fair value of plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on risk \n free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company\'s obligations. \n The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. \nWhen the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the total of \nany unrecognized past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of \n any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. \n \nThe Company recognizes all re-measurements of net defined benefit liability/asset directly in other \ncomprehensive income and presented within equity. The Company has employees’ gratuity fund under \nGrasim Industries Limited Employees Gratuity Trust managed by the ultimate parent company. \n \nShort Term Benefit \nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as \nthe related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under short-\n term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to \npay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated \n reliably. \n \nCompensated Absences \nThe employees of the Company are entitled to compensated absences. The employees can carry forward \n a portion of the unutilised accumulating compensated absences and utilise it in future periods or receive \n cash at retirement or termination of employment. The Company records an obligation for compensated \n absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement.  \nThe Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional amount that the \nCompany expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the \nreporting period.  \nThe  Company  recognises  accumulated  compensated  absences  based  on  actuarial  valuation.  Non-\naccumulating compensated absences are recognised in the period in which the absences occur. The \nCompany recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \nOther Benefits \nFew employees transferred from other business of the Aditya Birla Capital Group were eligible under \nlong term incentive plan (the “LTIP scheme”) issued by that business in September 2017. The scheme \nis for 4 years and pay out under the scheme to employees will be made at end of 4 years, as per option \n opted by the employees. This is a one time option, which cannot be changed to the option of early \nvesting, hence liability has been equally spread over the tenure. In case these employees leave before \nthe stipulated period of 4 years, the liability to pay under the aforesaid LTIP scheme ceases. \n \n Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n \n \n5.9\n \nLeases \n \nAS per IND AS 116 \nThe Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land and buildings. The Company \nassesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease \n if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange \n for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified \nasset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the \nCompany has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the \nlease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n \nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes right – of – use (“ROU”) asset and \na corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a \nterm of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low \nvalue leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line \nbasis over the term of the lease. \n \nCertain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the \n lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they \n will be exercised. \nThe right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease \nliability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus \nany  initial  direct  costs  less  any  lease  incentives.  They  are  subsequently  measured  at  cost  less \naccumulated depreciation and impairment losses. \nRight-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the \nshorter of the lease term and useful life of the under lying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for \nrecoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may \nnot be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of \nthe fair value less cost to sell and the value – in – use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless \nthe asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent of those from other assets. In such cases, the \n recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. \nThe  lease  liability  is initially measured at amortised  cost at the  present value of  the future lease \npayments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not \nreadily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. \nLease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the \nCompany changes its assessment on exercise of an extension or a termination option. \nLease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments \nhave been classified as financing cash flows. \n \n5.10\n \n Provisions \n \nProvisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result \nof a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be \nrequired to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nProvisions  are  not  discounted  to  their  present  value  and  are  determined  based  on  management \nestimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each balance \n sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current management estimates. \n \n5.11\n \n Taxes \nCurrent Tax  \nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or \npaid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that \nare enacted  or substantively enacted,  at the  reporting date in  the countries where  the Company \noperates and generates taxable income. Current income tax relating to items recognized outside profit \nor loss is recognized outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or in equity). Current \ntax items are recognized in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. \nManagement periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which \n applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. \n \nDeferred Tax  \nDeferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet approach on the temporary differences between the \n carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the amounts used for taxation \npurposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary \ndifferences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by \nthe reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, if there is a legally enforceable right to \noffset current tax liabilities and assets, and these relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority \n and are intended to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or such tax assets and liabilities \n will be realised simultaneously. \nIn the event of unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses under tax laws, deferred tax assets \nare recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available to \nrealise such assets. \nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be \navailable against which the temporary difference can be utilised.  \nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced \n to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or \npart of the assets to be recovered.  \nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except when the same relate \nto items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the \ncurrent and deferred tax relating to such items are also recognised in other comprehensive income or \ndirectly in equity respectively. \n \n5.12\n \n Earnings Per Share \nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable to \nequity shareholders (after deducting preference dividends and attributable taxes) by the weighted \naverage number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average numbers of \nequity shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for events of bonus issue; bonus element in a \nrights issue to existing shareholders; share split; and reverse share split, if any. \nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period attributable \n to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period are \nadjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n5.13\n \nCapital Management \nThe primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to maximize the shareholder value. The \nCompany  manages  its  capital  structure  and  makes  adjustments  in  light  of  changes  in  economic \nconditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, \nthe Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue \nnew shares. \n \n5.14\n \nSignificant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions  \nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity, with the Ind AS requires management to make \njudgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets \nand liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates \ncould result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities \n affected in next financial years  \n \nMeasurement of Defined Benefit Obligations \nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are \ndetermined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that \nmay differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount \nrate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and \nits long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All \n assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. \n \nProvisions  \nProvisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will be a \nfuture outflow of funds resulting from past operations or events and the amount of cashflow can be \nreliably estimated. The timing of recognition and quantification of the liability requires the application \nof judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change. The carrying amount \nof provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of changing facts and \ncircumstances.  \n \n Property plant and equipment and investment property  \nThe charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s \nexpected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful life and residual \nvalues of the Company\'s assets at the end of its useful life are estimated by management at the time the \n asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful life are based \n on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact \ntheir life, such as changes in technology. \n \nImpairment of trade receivables \n  \nTrade receivables are the trusts of which Company is a trustee and also holds investments in the trust \nthrough Security Receipts. The Company estimates the probability of collection of accounts receivable \nby analyzing the future cash flow in  the trust. If  the  financial condition of the trust deteriorates, \nadditional allowances may be required. \n \nFair Value of financial instruments  \nThe fair value of financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to \ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the \nmeasurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price) regardless of whether that price Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nis directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. When the fair values of financial \nassets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, they \n are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the use of valuation models. The \ninputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, \n estimation is required in establishing fair values.  \nJudgements and estimates include considerations of liquidity and model inputs related to items such as \ncredit risk (both own and counterparty), funding value adjustments, correlation and volatility. \n \nECL on financial asset \nThe measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in \nparticular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when \ndetermining  impairment  losses  and  the  assessment  of  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk.  These \nestimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result in different level of allowances. \n The Company ECL calculation are outputs of models with a number of underlying assumptions regarding \n the choice of variable inputs ad their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models that are considered \n accounting judgements and estimates includes: \n\uf0b7\n \nProbabilities  of  Defaults  (PDs)  the  calculations  of  which  includes  historical  data,  assumptions  and \nexpectations of future conditions. \n\uf0b7\n \nThe  Company’s  criteria  for  assessing  if  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk and  so \nallowances for financial assets should be measured on a life time expected credit loss model basis and \nthe qualitative assessment \n\uf0b7\n \nThe segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis \n\uf0b7\n \nDevelopments of ECL models, including the various formulas and choices of inputs \n\uf0b7\n \nDetermination  of  associations  between  macroeconomic  scenarios  and  economic  inputs,  such  as \nunemployment levels and collateral values, and the effects of PDs, exposure at defaults and loss given \ndefaults. \n      \nCritical judgements required in the application of Ind AS 116 may include, among others, the following:\n  \n \n\uf0b7\n \nIdentifying whether a contract (or part of a contract) includes a lease; \n  \n \n\uf0b7\n \nDetermining whether it is reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be exercised; \n  \n\uf0b7\n \nDetermination of whether variable payments are in-substance fixed; \n  \n \n\uf0b7\n \nEstablishing whether there are multiple leases in an arrangement; \n  \n \n\uf0b7\n \nDetermining the stand-alone selling prices of lease and non-lease components. \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nKey sources of estimation uncertainty in the application of Ind AS 116 may include, among others, the following:\n  \n \n\uf0b7\n \nEstimation of the lease term; \n  \n \n\uf0b7\n \nDetermination of the appropriate rate to discount the lease payments; \n  \n \n\uf0b7\n \nAssessment of whether a right-of-use asset is impaired. \n \n  \n \nPolicy for sales out of amortised cost business model portfolios \nABARC existing business model focuses on acquisition of financial assets through trusts, with or without \nparticipation  from  external  investors.  Our  existing  resolution  strategy  is  to  right  size  the  debt  and \nrestructure the debt with focus on improvement in operational performance of the acquired financial \nassets with existing sponsors or strategic investors. Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Standalone Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n  At present ABARC has no amortised cost business model portfolio, therefore it has not prepared and \nadopted any such policy. \n \n5.15\n \nRecent pronouncements \nThe following standards / amendments to standards have been issued and will be effective from 1st \nApril  2022.

the statement of profit and loss and  the balance sheet for \nthe gratuity plan of the Company.\n\nAmounts recognized in the Balance sheet in respect of Gratuity\nThe plan is of a final salary defined benefit in nature which is sponsored by the Company and hence it underwrites all the risks pertaining to the \nplan. In particular, there is a risk for the Company that any adverse salary growth or demographic experience or inadequate returns on \nunderlying plan assets can result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future. Since the benefits are lump sum in \nnature the plan is not subject to any longevity risks.\nNotes forming part of  Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2022\n\nThe amounts charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the year for Provident fund contribution aggregates to Rs. 22.60 lakhs (March \n\n31, 2021 – Rs. 20.02 lakhs).\n\nThe Company operates gratuity plan through a trust wherein every employee is entitled to the benefit equivalent to fifteen days salary last \ndrawn for each completed year of service. The same is payable on termination of service or retirement, whichever is earlier. The benefit vests \n\nafter five years of continuous service. In case of some employees, the Company’s scheme is more favorable as compared to the obligation under \n\nPayment of Gratuity Act, 1972. \n\nThe Company operates a defined benefit final salary gratuity plan which is open to new entrants. The gratuity benefits payable to the employees \n\nare based on the employee’s service and last drawn salary at the time of leaving. The employees do not contribute towards this plan and the full \n\ncost of providing these benefits are met by the Company.Aditya Birla ARC Limited\n\nNotes forming part of  Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2022\n\nChanges in Fair Value of Plan Assets\n Rs.

The operations \nof the company are subject to regulatory requirements within the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.\n\nThe Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, preference shares. The Company assessed the concentration of risk \n\nwith respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.

The cash attributable to the Company\'s share in expected gross recoveries \nwill be dependant on the Company\'s investment share and terms of the SR subscribed.\n\nDiscount margin/spreads represent the discount rates used when calculating the present value of future cash flows. In discounted cash flow models such spread are added to \nthe benchmark rate when discounting the future expected cash flows. Hence these spreads are reduce the net present value of an asset or increase the value of liability. They \ngenerally reflect the premium an investor expects to achieve over the benchmark interest rate to compensate for the higher risk driven by the uncertainty of the cash flows \ncaused by the credit quaity of the asset. They can be implied from the underlying deal documents and are usually unobservable for illiquid or complex instruments.\n\nExpected Cash flow levels including timing of cash flows are estimated by using quantitative and qualitative measures regarding the characteristics of the underlying assets \nincluding default rates, manner of resolution and other economic drivers. The manner of resolution is determined based on financial position and negotiaitions with \ncounterparty.\n Significant Unobservable Input\n\nThe primary objective of the Company’s risk and financial management framework is to protect the Company’s shareholders from events that hinder the sustainable achievement of financial \n\nperformance objectives, including failing to exploit opportunities.

When controls fail to perform, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or \nregulatory implications or can lead to financial loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but by initiating a rigorous control framework and by monitoring and responding to \npotential risks, the Company is able to manage the risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access controls, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment \n\nprocesses, including the use of internal audit. Business risks such as changes in environment, technology and the industry are monitored through the Company’s strategic planning and budgeting \n\nprocess. Internal control deficiency are reviewed by management and audit committee on periodic basis.\n\nCredit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a customer contract or financial instrument, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk \nfrom its operating activities primarily trade receivables and from its financing/ investing activities, including deposits with banks, investments in security Receipts. The carrying amount of following \nfinancial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure:\n\nCOVID–19 virus continues to spread across the globe including India, resulting in significant volatility in financial markets and a significant decrease in global and India’s economic activities.

On March 24, 2020, the Indian Government announced a 21 – days lockdown which was further extended \n\nin phases up to May 31, 2020 across the nation to contain the spread of the virus. Though the restrictions were eased post the lockdown, the situation has again deteriorated in the recent past. The \nstate governments have started placing restrictions in various parts.\nIn preparing the accompanying financial statements, the Company management has been required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and \nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. These estimates and associated assumptions, especially for determining the fair value of the Company security receipts \ninvestments, are based on historical experience and various other factors including the possible effects that may result from the pandemic, that are believed to be reasonable under the current \ncircumstances. The Company has used internal and external sources of information including credit reports, economic forecasts and consensus estimates from market sources on the expected future \nperformance of the underlying companies in developing the estimates and assumptions to assess, without undue cost and efforts, the fair value of the investments as at March 31, 2022.\nGiven the dynamic nature of the pandemic situation, in the event the impacts are more severe or prolonged than anticipated, this may have a corresponding impact on the carrying value of the \nsecurity receipts investments, the financial position and performance of the Company.\nNOTE: 45 COVID-19Aditya Birla ARC Limited\n\nNotes forming part of  Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2022\n\nNOTE: 52 Segment Information\n\nNOTE: 53 Additional disclosures as required by RBI guidelines\n\nRs. in Lakhs\n\nAcquisition price\nAcquisition price\n\nSponsors\n\nNone\n -\n                                                   \n \n-\n                              \n \n\nSub Total (A)\n\nNon sponsors\n\nDewan Housing Finance Limited\n 15.00\n                                               \n \n15.00\n                         \n \n\nPower Finance Corporation Limited\n 75,584.11\n                                        \n \n75,584.11\n                  \n \n\nState Bank of India\n 52,879.17\n                                        \n \n52,879.17\n                  \n \n\nRural Electrification Corporation Limited\n 29,761.07\n                                        \n \n29,761.07\n                  \n \n\nBank of India\n 17,429.22\n                                        \n \n17,429.22\n                  \n \n\nAxis Bank Limited\n 10,647.94\n                                        \n \n10,647.94\n                  \n \n\nUCO Bank\n 9,894.41\n                                          \n \n9,894.41\n                    \n \n\nLife Insurance Corporation of India\n 7,716.32\n                                          \n \n7,716.32\n                    \n \n\nCentral Bank of India\n 8,414.85\n                                          \n \n8,414.85\n                    \n \n\nCanara bank\n 19,516.91\n                                        \n \n19,516.91\n                  \n \n\nUnited Bank of India\n 7,461.31\n                                          \n \n7,461.31\n                    \n \n\nSyndicate Bank\n 5,905.24\n                                          \n \n5,905.24\n                    \n \n\nPunjab National Bank\n 32,180.17\n                                        \n \n32,180.17\n                  \n \n\nAxis Bank Limited\n 42,500.00\n                                        \n \n42,500.00\n                  \n \n\nBank of Baroda\n 13,050.00\n                                        \n \n13,050.00\n                  \n \n\nKarnataka Bank\n 3,395.00\n                                          \n \n3,395.00\n                    \n \n\nPunjab National Bank\n 75,240.00\n                                        \n \n-\n                              \n \n\nSub Total (B)\n 4,11,590.72\n                                    \n \n3,36,350.72\n              \n \n\nTotal (A + B)\n 4,11,590.72\n                                    \n \n3,36,350.72\n              \n \n\nRs. in Lakhs\n\nRetail (Housing Loan)\n 15.00\n                                              \n \n0.00%\n15.00\n                                               \n \n0.00%\n\n4,11,575.72\n                                   \n \n100.00%\n3,16,758.72\n                                    \n \n94.18%\n\n-\n                                                   \n \n0.00%\n19,577.00\n                                        \n \n5.82%\n\nTotal\n 4,11,590.72\n                                   \n \n100.00%\n3,36,350.72\n                                    \n \n100.00%\n\n(C) Other additional disclosures:\n\nRs. in Lakhs\n\n31st March 2022\n31st March 2021\n\nValue of financial assets acquired during the financial year\n                                          75,240.00 \n                    58,945.00 \n\nValue of financial asset realized during the financial year\n                                          85,650.17 \n                    95,215.39 \n\n                                      2,05,450.91 \n                 2,15,856.54 \n\n                                      1,26,245.78 \n                 1,02,882.68 \n\nValue of security receipts pending for redemption as at the end of the financial year\n                                       1,81,340.76 \n                 2,32,346.54 \n\n-\n                                                   \n \n-\n                              \n \n\nValue of land and/or building acquired in ordinary course of business of reconstruction of assets\n -\n                                                   \n \n-\n                              \n \n\nRs.

\nAditya Birla ARC Limited (the Company) was incorporated as a public limited company under the \nprovisions of the Companies Act, 2013 on March 10, 2017.  \n \nThe Company and its Trusts as at 31 March 2022 are together referred to as “Group”. The \nprincipal activity of the Group is to carry on the business of securitization and asset reconstruction \n as  defined  in  section  2  of  the  Securitization  and  Reconstruction  of  Financial  Assets  and \nEnforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (‘the SARFAESI Act’). The Group acts as a Manager / \nTrustee for trusts set up for securitization pursuant to the SARFAESI Act. The financial assets are \nacquired under separate trusts set up for securitization or directly for asset reconstruction. \nReserve  Bank  of  India  (‘RBI’)  granted  a  Certificate  of  Registration  to  the  Company  on \n13 March 2018 to carry on business of securitization or asset reconstruction under section 3 of \nthe SARFAESI Act. \nThe Group recognises its income through Trusteeship and Management Fee, which is recognized \n on accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective trust deed / offer document / \ncommitment agreement, wherever applicable. \nThe financial statements were authorized for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on April \n21, 2022.  \n \n2.\n \nBasis of preparation of Financial Statements \nThe financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting \n Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as \namended from time to time). \n \nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis and accrual basis except \nfor fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) instruments, derivative financial \ninstruments, other financial assets held for trading and financial assets and liabilities designated \nat fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), all of which have been measured at fair value. The \nfinancial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) and all values are rounded to the \nnearest lakhs, except when otherwise indicated. \n \n \n3.\n \nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IND AS requires the management to \nmake judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, \nexpenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the \nreporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management’s best knowledge of \ncurrent events and actions, uncertainly about these assumptions and estimates could result in \nthe outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in \nfuture periods. \n \n4.\n \nPresentation of Financial Estimates\n  \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported gross in the balance sheet. They \nare only offset and reported net when, in addition to having an unconditional legally enforceable Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nright to offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event, the parties \nalso intend to settle on a net basis in all of the following circumstances: \n-The normal course of business. \n-The event of default. \n-The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group and/or its counterparties. \n \n5.\n \nBasis of Consolidation  \nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its \nTrusts (hereinafter referred to as “structured entities”) as at 31st March 2022 (together referred \n to as “Group”). The Group consolidates a structured entity when it controls it. Control is achieved \n when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the \ninvestee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Generally, \n there  is  a  presumption  that  a  majority  of  voting  rights  result  in  control.  To  support  this \npresumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an \ninvestee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has \npower over an investee, including: \n -The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee. \n -Rights arising from other contractual arrangements. \n -The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights. \n-The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of the holdings \n of the other voting rights holders. \n \nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate \nthat there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a \nstructured entity begins when the Group obtains control over the structured entity and ceases \nwhen the Group loses control of the structured entity. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of \n a structured entity acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements \n from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the structured \nentity. \nConsolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  using  uniform  accounting  policies  for  like \ntransactions and other events in similar circumstances.  \nThe financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to \nsame reporting date as that of the parent Group, i.e., year ended on 31 March. \n \nConsolidation Procedure: - \nStructured Entities: \nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its \nstructured Entities. Structured Entities are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls \nan investee only if, the Group has: \nPower over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant \nactivities of the investee) \nExposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and the ability to \nuse its power over the investee to affect its returns. \n \nThe Group combines the financial statement of the Parent and its structured entities line by line \nadding  together  like  items.  Inter-  Group  transactions,  balances  and  unrealised  gains  on Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\ntransactions between the Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated \n unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred assets. \n \nProfit or loss and each component of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) are attributed to the \nequity holders of the Parent of the Group and to the non- controlling interests, even if this results \n in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made \nto the financial statements of structured entities to bring their accounting policies into line with \nthe Group’s accounting policies. All inter-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses \nand cash flows relating to transactions between the members of the Group are eliminated in full \n on consolidation. \n \nA change in the ownership interest of a structured entity, without a loss of control, is accounted \nfor as an equity transaction. When the Group loses control of a structured entity, the profit or \nloss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of \nconsideration received and the fair value of any retained interest; and (ii) the carrying amount of \n the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the structured entity and any non-controlling \ninterests.  Amounts  previously  recognised  in  OCI  in  relation  to  the  structured  entities  are \naccounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the \n same manner, as would be required, if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair \n value of any investment retained in the former structured entity at the date when control is lost \nis regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under Ind AS 109 \nFinancial Instruments or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an \nassociate or joint venture. \n   Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n \n6.\n \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies \n \n6.1\n \nRevenue from contract with customer \n \nRevenue (other than for those items to which Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments are applicable) is \nmeasured at transaction price i.e. the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be \n entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to the customer, excluding \namounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group consider the terms of the contract and \nits customary business practices to determine the transaction price.  \n \nWhere the consideration promised is variable, the Group excludes the estimates of variable \nconsideration that are constrained. Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers outlines \na single comprehensive model of accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.  \n \nThe Group recognises revenue from the following sources:  \n \na.  The  fee  income  comprises  of  Trusteeship  and  Management  Fee.  The  Group  receives \nmanagement fee from trusts declared by it for acquisition of financial assets and the same is \naccounted for on accrual basis as per terms of the relevant trust deeds and offer document issued \n by the Trust. Management fees are calculated and charged as a percentage of the Net Assets \nValue (NAV) at the lower end of the range of the NAV specified by the Credit Rating Agency.  \nb. Redemption incentive and recovery incentive is accounted over the period on cash basis, i.e. \nas and when received by the Group, based on terms of the relevant trust deeds and offer \ndocument issued by the Trust.  \nc. Any upside share in excess realisation over acquisition price of financial asset by trust is \nrecognised at point in time basis as per terms of the relevant trust deed/offer document.  \nd. The above receipts are recognised as revenue excluding GST. \n \nRental Income \nTemporary arrangements were made to give unoccupied workstations to other businesses, rent \nwere charged for the period on these workstations on basis of area wise cost allocation. \n \nInterest Income \nThe Group calculates interest income by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial \n assets other than credit-impaired assets.   \nWhen a financial asset becomes credit-impaired and is, therefore, regarded as ‘Stage 3’, the \nGroup calculates interest income by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost \n of the financial asset. If the financial assets cures and is no longer credit-impaired, the Group \nreverts to calculating interest income on a gross basis. \nFor interest income on Fixed Deposit, the Group recognizes it on accrual basis \nFor purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets, the Group calculates interest \n income by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortised cost of the \nasset. The credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the \nestimated future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortised cost of the POCI assets. Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nInterest income on all trading assets and financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at \n FVTPL is recognised using the contractual interest rate in net gain on fair value changes. \n6.2\n \nFinancial Instruments:  \nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a \nfinancial liability or equity instrument of another entity. \nFinancial Assets  \n \nDate of Recognition \nFinancial assets and liabilities, debt securities, deposits and borrowings are initially recognised \non the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of \nthe instrument \n \nInitial Measurement \nThe classification of financial instruments at initial recognition depends on their contractual \nterms and the business model for managing the instruments. Financial instruments are initially \nmeasured at their fair value, except in the case of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded \n at FVTPL, transaction costs are added to, or subtracted from, this amount. Trade receivables are \nmeasured at the transaction price. \n \nMeasurement categories of financial assets and liabilities \nThe Group classifies all of its financial assets based on the business model for managing the assets \n and the asset’s contractual terms, measured at either: \n \n-\n \nDebt instruments at amortised cost \n-\n \nDebt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) \n-\n \nDebt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments, mutual funds at fair value through \n profit or loss (FVTPL) \n-\n \nEquity  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income \n(FVTOCI) \n \nDebt instruments at amortised cost\n  \nA ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: \na.\n \nThe asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting \ncontractual cash flows, and \nb.\n \nContractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely \npayments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. \n \nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost \nusing the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account \n any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The \n EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from \nimpairment are recognised in the profit or loss. \n \n Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nDebt instrument at FVTOCI\n \nA ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: \na.\n \nThe objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows \n and selling the financial assets, and \nb.\n \nThe asset’s contractual cash flows represent Solely Payments of Principal and Interest \n(SPPI). \n \nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each \nreporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive \nincome (OCI). However, the Group recognises interest income, impairment losses & reversals and \n foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, \ncumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to Statement \nof profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest \nincome using the EIR method. \nDebt instrument at FVTPL\n \nFVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the \n criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. \nIn  addition,  the  Group  may  elect  to  designate  a  debt  instrument,  which  otherwise  meets \namortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so \n reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting \nmismatch’). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with \n all changes recognised in the Statement of profit and loss. \nDe-Recognition of Financial Assets \nThe Group de-recognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the \n asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of \n ownership of the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially \nall the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group \nrecognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to \n pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred \nfinancial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises an \nassociated liability. \nOn de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying \namount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss \n that  had  been  recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in  equity  is \nrecognised in profit and loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit \nor loss on disposal of that financial assets.  \nOn derecognition of a financial asset other than in it’s entirety (e.g. when the Group retains an \noption to repurchase part of a transferred asset), the Group allocates the previous carrying \namount of the financials asset between the part it continues to recognise under continuing \ninvolvement, and the part is no longer recognises on the basis of relative fair values of those parts \n on the date of transfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part that is \n no longer recognised and the sum of consideration received for the part no longer recognised \nand  and  any  cumulative  gain  or  loss  allocated  to  it  that  had  been  recognised  in  other \ncomprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise \nbeen recognised in profit or loss on  disposal  in profit or loss if such gain or loss would have \notherwise been recognised in profit or loss on disposal of that financial asset. A cumulative gain Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nor loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is allocated between the part \nthat continues to be recognised and the part that is no longer recognised on the basis of the \nrelative fair values of those parts. \nImpairment of Financial Assets (ECL Policy) \nIn  accordance  with  IND  AS  109,  the  Group  applies  expected  credit  loss  (ECL)  model  for \nmeasurement and recognition of impairment loss on financial assets & credit risk exposure. \n \nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset (or a group of financial \nassets) such as loans and advances held at amortised cost for impairment based on evidence or \n information that is available without undue cost or effort. \n \nThe  Group  applies  a  three-stage  approach  to  measuring  expected  credit  losses  (ECLs)  for \nfinancial assets. \n \nStage 1: 12-months ECL \nAll  exposures  where  there  has  not  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  since  initial \nrecognition or that has low credit risk at the reporting date and that are not credit impaired \nupon origination are classified under this stage. The Group has assessed that all loans and \nadvances with no default or upto 30 days default would fall under this category.  \nFor these assets, 12-month ECL are recognized and interest revenue is calculated on the gross \ncarrying amount of the asset (that is, without deduction for credit allowance). \n \nStage 2: Lifetime ECL – Significant increase in credit risk \nLifetime ECL are the expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the \nexpected life of a financial asset. Financial instruments that have had a significant increase in \ncredit risk since initial recognition are classified under this stage. 30 Days Past Due is considered \n as significant increase in credit risk and classified under this category. For these assets, lifetime \nECL are recognized, but interest revenue is calculated on the gross carrying amount of the asset \n less ECL already provided. \n \nStage 3: Lifetime ECL – Credit Impaired \nAll exposures assessed as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental \nimpact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred are classified in this stage. \n For exposures that have become credit impaired, a lifetime ECL is recognised and interest \nrevenue  is calculated by applying the effective interest rate  to the amortised cost (net of \nprovision) rather than the gross carrying amount. \n \nCredit-impaired financial assets: \nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost is \ncredit impaired. A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when a breach of contract such as a default \n or past due event that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the \nfinancial asset have occurred. \nECL provisioning is being done on each reporting date basis probability of default and loss given \n default on outstanding financial asset. \n \nPurchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets: \nPOCI  financial  assets  are  treated  differently  because  the  asset  is  credit-impaired  at  initial \nrecognition. For these assets, the Group recognises all changes in lifetime ECL since initial \nrecognition as a loss allowance with any changes recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. A \nfavorable change for such assets creates an impairment gain. Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n \nTrade Receivables \nTrade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result \nfrom transactions that are within the scope of IND AS 115 are recognized. The Company provides \n 0.4% ECL on prudential basis on Standard Assets. \n  \nOther Financial Assets \nOther financial assets are tested for impairment based on significant change in credit risk since \ninitial recognition and impairment is measured based on probability of default over the lifetime \nwhen there is significant increase in credit risk. The Company provides 0.4% ECL on prudential \nbasis on Standard Assets. \n \nFinancial Liabilities \nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through \nprofit or loss, debt securities and subordinated liabilities, as appropriate. All financial liabilities \nare recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of \n directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other \npayables,  loans  and  borrowings  including  bank  overdrafts.  The  measurement  of  financial \nliabilities depends on their classification, as described below:  \n \nFinancial liabilities at fair- value through profit or loss: \nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading \nand financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss.  \n \nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are \ndesignated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IND AS 109 are \nsatisfied.  \n \nFor liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit \nrisk is recognized in OCI.  \nThese gains/ loss are not subsequently transferred to P&L. However, the Group may transfer the \n cumulative gain or loss within equity. \n \nAll other changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. \nThe Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss. \n \nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments \nFinancial instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity \nin accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a \nfinancial liability and an equity instrument. \n \nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity \nafter deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Group entity are recognized at \nthe proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. \n \nLoans & Borrowings Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at \namortized cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the \nliabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.  \nAmortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and \nfees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs \n in the statement of profit and loss \n \nDe-recognition of financial liabilities \nA financial liability shall be de-recognized when, and only when, it is extinguished i.e. when the \nobligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires. \n \n6.3\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-\nterm investments with an original maturity of three months or less which are subject to an \ninsignificant risk of changes in value. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and \ncash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as defined above, net of outstanding \nbank overdrafts as they are considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management. \n \n6.4\n \nProperty, Plant & Equipment \nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and \nrebates less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes purchase \n price, borrowing cost and any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its working \ncondition for its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and arrangements \narising from exchange rate variations attributable to the assets. Subsequent costs are included in \n the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is \nprobable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow the entity and the cost \n can be measured reliably. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is provided using \nstraight line method. Depreciation is provided based on useful life of the assets as prescribed in \nSchedule II to the Companies Act, 2013.  \nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipment \nare reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Gains or losses \n arising from derecognition of a property, plant and equipment are measured as the difference \nbetween the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in \nthe Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. \n \nDepreciation on Tangible Fixed Assets is provided on Straight Line using the rates arrived at based \n on the useful lives as specified in the Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 or estimated by the \n management. The Group has used the following useful life to provide depreciation on its fixed \nassets, which is in line with the useful life suggested by Schedule III. \nAsset \n Useful Life as Prescribed by Schedule II of the \nCompanies  Act, 2013 \nComputers (end user computers, Laptops)  3 \nOffice Equipment  5 \nFurniture & Fixtures  10 \n \n Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n \n \n \nUseful life of assets estimated by management supported by the Internal Technical assessment. \n \n \n \n \n \n*In case of Leasehold Improvements, Depreciation calculated based on lease period \n^ In case of Motor Vehicles, depreciation calculated on basis of its replacement. \n \nDepreciation on the Fixed Assets added/disposed off/discarded during the year is provided on \npro-rata basis with reference to the date of addition/disposal/discarding. \n \n6.5\n \n Fair Value Measurement \n The Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair value is \nthe price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly \ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement \nis based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes \nplace either in the principal market for the asset or the liability; or in the absence of a principal \nmarket, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability, the principal or the most \nadvantageous market must be accessible by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liability is \nmeasured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or \nliability, assuming that  market participants act  in  their economic best interest. A  fair value \nmeasurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes  into  account  a  market  participant\'s  ability  to \ngenerate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another \n market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.  \n \nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which \nsufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable \ninputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. \n \nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements \nare categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level \ninput that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: \nLevel-1- Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \nLevel-2- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement is directly or indirectly observable \nLevel-3- Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement is unobservable. \n \n6.6\n \nImpairment of Non-Financial Assets \nThe Group assesses, at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be \nimpaired.  If  any  such  indication  exists  or  when  annual  impairment  testing  for  any  asset  is \nrequired, the Group estimates the assets recoverable amount. An assets recoverable amount is \n\nAsset \n Estimated Useful Life\n \nLeasehold Improvements *  3 \nMotor Vehicles^  4-5 Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nthe higher of an assets fair value less cost of disposal and its value in use. Recoverable amount is \n determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflow that is largely \nindependent of those from other assets or Group of assets. When the carrying amount of an \nasset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written-down to it \nrecoverable amount. \n \n6.7\n \nRetirement and Other Employee Benefits \nEmployee benefits are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by \nemployees of the Group, as detailed below: \n \nDefined contribution plan (Provident fund) \nIn accordance with Indian law, eligible employees receive benefits from provident fund, which is \na defined contribution plan. Both the employee and employer make monthly contributions to \nthe plan, each equal to a specified percentage of employee\'s basic salary. The Group has no \nfurther obligations under the plan beyond its monthly contributions. The Group does not have \nany  legal  or  constructive obligation  to  pay  further  contributions  if  the  fund  does  not  hold \nsufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior \n periods. Obligation for contributions to the plan is recognized as an employee benefit expense in \n the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. \n \nDefined Benefit Plans (Gratuity) \nIn accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit \nretirement plan (the Gratuity Plan) covering eligible employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a \nlump  sum  payment  to  vested  employees,  at  retirement  or  termination  of  employment,  an \namount based on the respective employee\'s last drawn salary and the years of employment with \n the Group.  \nThe Group\'s net obligation in respect of the gratuity plan is calculated by estimating the amount \nof future benefits that the employees have earned in return for their service in the current and \nprior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Any unrecognized past \nservice cost and the fair value of plan assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield at the \nreporting date on risk free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms \n of the Group\'s obligations. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the \n projected  unit  credit  method.  When  the  calculation  results  in  a  benefit  to  the  Group,  the \nrecognized asset is limited to the total of any unrecognized past service costs and the present \nvalue of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions \n in future contributions to the plan. \n \nThe Group recognizes all re-measurements of net defined benefit liability/asset directly in other \ncomprehensive income and presented within equity. The Group has employees’ gratuity fund \nunder Grasim Industries Limited Employees Gratuity Trust managed by the ultimate parent \nGroup. \n \nShort Term Benefit \nShort-term  employee  benefit  obligations  are  measured  on  an  undiscounted  basis  and  are \nexpensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to \nbe paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nconstructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee \nand the obligation can be estimated reliably. \n \n \nCompensated Absences \nThe employees of the Group are entitled to compensated absences. The employees can carry \nforward a portion of the unutilised accumulating compensated absences and utilise it in future \nperiods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment. The Group records an \nobligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services \nthat increases this entitlement.  \nThe Group measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional amount that \nthe Group expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end \nof the reporting period.  \nThe Group recognises accumulated compensated absences based on actuarial valuation. Non-\naccumulating compensated absences are recognised in the period in which the absences occur. \nThe Group recognises actuarial gains and losses immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \nOther Benefits \nFew employees transferred from other business of the Aditya Birla Capital Group were eligible \nunder long term incentive plan (the “LTIP scheme”) issued by that business in September 2017. \nThe scheme is for 4 years and pay out under the scheme to employees will be made at end of 4 \nyears, as per option opted by the employees. This is a one time option, which cannot be changed \n to the option of early vesting, hence liability has been equally spread over the tenure. In case \nthese employees leave before the stipulated period of 4 years, the liability to pay under the \naforesaid LTIP scheme ceases. \n \n6.8\n \nLeases \n \nAS per IND AS 116 \nThe Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for land and buildings. The Group \nassesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, \n a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of \ntime in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the \n use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an \nidentified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset \n through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. \n \nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes right – of – use (“ROU”) asset \nand a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for \nleases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these \nshort-term and low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating \nexpense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \n \nCertain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end \n of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably \ncertain that they will be exercised. \nThe right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the \nlease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nthe lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured \nat cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. \nRight-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over \nthe shorter of the lease term and useful life of the under lying asset. Right of use assets are \nevaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their \ncarrying  amounts  may  not  be  recoverable.  For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  the \nrecoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value – in – use) is \ndetermined on an individual asset basis unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely \ndependent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for \nthe Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. \nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease \npayments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if \nnot readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the \n leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of \nuse asset if the Group changes its assessment on exercise of an extension or a termination option. \n Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease \npayments have been classified as financing cash flows. \n \n6.9\n \nProvisions \nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a \nresult of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic \nbenefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the \namount of the obligation.  \nProvisions are not discounted to their present value and are determined based on management \nestimate required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. These are reviewed at each \nbalance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current management estimates. \n \n6.10\n \n Taxes \nCurrent Tax  \nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered \nfrom or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount \nare those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where \n the  Group  operates  and  generates  taxable  income.  Current  income  tax  relating  to  items \nrecognized  outside  profit  or  loss  is  recognized  outside  profit  or  loss  (either  in  other \ncomprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are recognized in correlation to the \nunderlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates \npositions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations \nare subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. \n \nDeferred Tax  \nDeferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet approach on the temporary differences \nbetween  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  financial  statements  and  the \namounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected \n to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been \n enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are \noffset, if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and these Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nrelate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and are intended to settle current tax \nliabilities and assets on a net basis or such tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. \n In the event of unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses under tax laws, deferred tax \nassets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will \nbe available to realise such assets. \nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will \nbe available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.  \nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and \nreduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available \nto allow all or part of the assets to be recovered.  \nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except when the same \nrelate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which \n case,  the  current  and  deferred  tax  relating  to  such  items  are  also  recognised  in  other \ncomprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. \n \n6.11\n \n Earnings Per Share \nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net profit or loss for the period attributable \n to equity shareholders (after deducting preference dividends and attributable taxes) by the \nweighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average \n numbers of equity shares outstanding during the period are adjusted for events of bonus issue; \nbonus element in a rights issue to existing shareholders; share split; and reverse share split, if \nany. \nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, the net profit or loss for the period \nattributable to equity shareholders and the weighted average number of shares outstanding \nduring the period are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. \n6.12\n \nCapital Management \nThe primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximize the shareholder value. \nThe Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic \nconditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital \nstructure,  the  Group  may  adjust  the  dividend  payment  to  shareholders,  return  capital  to \nshareholders or issue new shares. \n \n6.13\n \nSignificant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions \nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity, with the Ind AS requires management to \nmake judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue, \nexpenses,  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  accompanying  disclosures.  Uncertainty  about  these \nassumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the \ncarrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in next financial years.  \n \nMeasurement of Defined Benefit Obligations \nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are \ndetermined  using  actuarial  valuations.  An  actuarial  valuation  involves  making  various \nassumptions  that  may  differ  from  actual  developments  in  the  future.  These  include  the \ndetermination of  the  discount rate, future salary increases  and mortality rates. Due to  the \ncomplexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\nhighly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting \n date. \n \nProvisions  \nProvisions and liabilities are recognised in the period when it becomes probable that there will \nbe a future outflow of funds resulting from past operations or events and the amount of cashflow \n can be reliably estimated. The timing of recognition and quantification of the liability requires the \n application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change. \nThe carrying amount of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take \naccount of changing facts and circumstances.  \n \nProperty plant and equipment and investment property  \nThe charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an \nasset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful life \nand  residual  values  of  the  Group\'s  assets  at  the  end  of  its  useful  life  are  estimated  by \nmanagement at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each \nfinancial year end. The useful life are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as \n anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. \n \nImpairment of trade receivables \n  \nTrade receivables are the trusts of which Group is a trustee and also holds investments in the \ntrust through Security Receipts. The Group estimates the probability of collection of accounts \nreceivable by analyzing the future cash flow in the trust. If the financial condition of the trust \ndeteriorates, additional allowances may be required. \n \nFair Value of financial instruments  \nThe fair value of financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid \nto transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at \nthe measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price) regardless of whether \n that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. When the fair \nvalues of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be derived \n from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that include the \n use of valuation models. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where \npossible, but where this is not feasible, estimation is required in establishing fair values.  \nJudgements and estimates include considerations of liquidity and model inputs related to items \nsuch as credit risk (both own and counterparty), funding value adjustments, correlation and \nvolatility. \n \nECL on financial asset \nThe  measurement  of  impairment  losses  across  all  categories  of  financial  assets  requires \njudgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and \ncollateral  values  when  determining  impairment  losses  and  the  assessment  of  a  significant \nincrease in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can \nresult in different level of allowances. \nThe Group ECL calculation are outputs of models with a number of underlying assumptions \nregarding the choice of variable inputs ad their interdependencies. Elements of the ECL models \nthat are considered accounting judgements and estimates includes: Aditya Birla ARC Limited  \nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statement for the year ended 31\n st\n March 2022 \n \n \n\n\uf0b7\n \nProbabilities  of  Defaults  (PDs)  the  calculations  of  which  includes  historical  data, \nassumptions and expectations of future conditions. \n\uf0b7\n \nThe Group’s criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk and \n so allowances for financial assets should be measured on a life time expected credit loss \nmodel basis and the qualitative assessment \n\uf0b7\n \nThe segmentation of financial assets  when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis \n\uf0b7\n \nDevelopments of ECL models, including the various formulas and choices of inputs \n\uf0b7\n \nDetermination of associations between macroeconomic scenarios and economic inputs, \nsuch as unemployment levels and collateral values, and the effects of PDs, exposure at \ndefaults and loss given defaults. \nCritical judgements required in t\n he application of Ind AS 116 may include, among others, the \nfollowing: \n• Identifying whether a contract (or part of a contract) includes a lease;\n  \n• Determining whether it is reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be \nexercised; \n• Determination of whether variable payments are in\n -\nsubstance fixed;\n \n• Establishing whether there are multiple leases in an arrangement;\n  \n• Determining the stand\n-\nalone selling prices of lease and non\n -\nlease components.\n \n \nKey sources of estimation uncertainty in the application of Ind AS 116 may include, among others, \nthe following: \n• Estimation of the lease term;\n  \n• Determination of the appropriate rate to discount the lease payments;\n  \n• Assessment of \nwhether a right\n-\nof\n-\nuse asset is impaired.\n \n \n          Policy for sales out of amortised cost business model portfolios \nGroup existing business model focuses on acquisition of financial assets through trusts, with or \nwithout participation from external investors. Our existing resolution strategy is to right size the \ndebt and restructure the debt with focus on improvement in operational performance of the \nacquired financial assets with existing sponsors or strategic investors. \nAt present Group has no amortised cost business model portfolio, therefore it has not prepared \nand adopted any such policy. \n \n6.14\n \nRecent Pronouncements:  \nThe following standards / amendments to standards have been issued and will be effective from \n1st April 2022.

In \nparticular, there is a risk for the Company that any adverse salary growth or demographic experience or inadequate returns on underlying plan assets can \nresult in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future. Since the benefits are lump sum in nature the plan is not subject to any \nlongevity risks.\nNotes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March, 2022\n\nThe amounts charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the year for Provident fund contribution aggregates to Rs. 22.60 lakhs (March 31, 2021 – Rs. \n\n20.02 lakhs).\n\nThe Company operates gratuity plan through a trust wherein every employee is entitled to the benefit equivalent to fifteen days salary last drawn for each \ncompleted year of service. The same is payable on termination of service or retirement, whichever is earlier. The benefit vests after five years of continuous \n\nservice. In case of some employees, the Company’s scheme is more favorable as compared to the obligation under Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. \n\nThe Company operates a defined benefit final salary gratuity plan which is open to new entrants.

However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, that is, to estimate an exit price.\n The following table provides the comparison of carrying value and fair value of the Company\'s Financial Assets and Liabilities as at 31st March 2022 & 31st March 2021.\n\nCarrying Value\n Fair Value\n\n33,950.37                                                                                        \n33,950.37                                                                                 \n39,632.54                                                                                 \n\n126.73                                                                                       \n39,632.54                                                                                        \n\n126.73                                                                                              \n\n332.81                                                                                       \n\n330.56                                                                                       \n3,535.88                                                                                          \n3,535.88                                                                                   \n45.63                                                                                                \n45.63                                                                                         \nCarrying Value\n\n35,790.25                                                                                 \n\nThe fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or \nliquidation sale.\n Fair Value\n\n1,600.00                                                                                   \n62.00                                                                                         \n\n28,223.19                                                                                 \n\n3,401.81                                                                                   \n\nFollowing table provides the fair value measurement hierarchy of the Company’s assets and liabilities as on 31st March 2022 & 31st March 2021\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n 35,790.25                                                                                        \n\n100.77                                                                                       \n\n38,450.16                                                                                        \n\n43,340.78                                                                                 \n\nCarrying Value\n\nFinancial Assets & Financial Liabilities not measured at fair value, including their levels in the fair value heirarchy are presented below.

Key management recognises the critical importance of having efficient and effective risk management systems in place.\n\nThe Company seeks to optimise the structure and sources of capital to ensure that it consistently maximises returns to the shareholders.\n\nRegulators are interested in ensuring that the Company maintains an appropriate solvency position to meet unforeseeable liabilities arising from economic shocks or natural disasters. The \noperations of the company are subject to regulatory requirements within the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.\n\nThe Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, preference shares. The Company assessed the concentration of \n\nrisk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. The Company manages its liquidity risk through temporary funding from its holding Company and availing bank overdraft as and \nwhen require.\nDiscount margin/spreads represent the discount rates used when calculating the present value of future cash flows. In discounted cash flow models such spread are added to \nthe benchmark rate when discounting the future expected cash flows. Hence these spreads are reduce the net present value of an asset or increase the value of liability. They \ngenerally reflect the premium an investor expects to achieve over the benchmark interest rate to compensate for the higher risk driven by the uncertainty of the cash flows \ncaused by the credit quaity of the asset. They can be implied from the underlying deal documents and are usually unobservable for illiquid or complex instruments.\n\nExpected Cash flow levels including timing of cash flows are estimated by using quantitative and qualitative measures regarding the characteristics of the underlysing assets \nincluding default rates, manner of resolution and other economic drivers.

arising from system failure, human error, fraud or external events. When controls fail to perform, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or \nregulatory implications or can lead to financial loss. The Company cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but by initiating a rigorous control framework and by monitoring and responding \nto potential risks, the Company is able to manage the risks. Controls include effective segregation of duties, access controls, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and \n\nassessment processes, including the use of internal audit. Business risks such as changes in environment, technology and the industry are monitored through the Company’s strategic planning and \n\nbudgeting process. Internal control deficiency are reviewed by management and audit committee on periodic basis.\n\nCredit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a customer contract or financial instrument, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk \nfrom its operating activities primarily trade receivables and from its financing/ investing activities, including deposits with banks, investments in security Receipts.
