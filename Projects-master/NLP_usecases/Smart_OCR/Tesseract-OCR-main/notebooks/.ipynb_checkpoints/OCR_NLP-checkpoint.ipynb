Potential Investors should carefully consi\\nder all the \\nrisk factors \\nin this Information Memorandum and/or the Private Placement Offer \\ncum Applicati\\non \\nLetter for evaluating the Company and its business and the Debentures before making any \\ninvestment decision relating to the Debentures. The Company believes that the factors described \\nbelow represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Debe\\nntures but does not represent \\nthat the statements below regarding risks of holding the Debentures are exhaustive. The ordering of \\nthe risk factors is intended to facilitate ease of reading and reference and does not in any manner \\nindicate the importance of\\n \\none risk factor over another. Potential Investors should also read the \\ndetailed information set out elsewhere in this Information Memorandum and/or the Private \\nPlacement Offer \\ncum Application \\nLetter and reach their own views prior to making any investment\\n \\ndecision.\\n \\n \\n3.1\\n \\nREPAYMENT IS SUBJECT TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE ISSUER.\\n \\n \\nPotential investors (\"\\nInvestors\\n\") should be aware that receipt of the principal amount, (i.e. the \\nredemption amount) and any other amounts that may be due in respect of the Debentures (as \\ndefined below) is subject to the credit risk of the Issuer. Potential Investors assume the risk that the \\nIssuer will not be able to satisfy their obligations under the Debentures. In the event that bankruptcy \\nproceedings or composition, scheme of arrangeme\\nnt or similar proceedings to avert bankruptcy are \\ninstituted by or against the Issuer, the payment of sums due on the Debentures may not be made or \\nmay be substantially reduced or delayed.\\n \\n \\n3.2\\n \\nTHE SECONDARY MARKET FOR DEBENTURES MAY BE ILLIQUID.\\n \\n \\nThe Debentur\\nes may be very illiquid and no secondary market may develop in respect thereof. \\nEven if there is a secondary market for the Debentures, it is not likely to provide significant \\nliquidity. Potential Investors may have to hold the Debentures until redemption \\nto realize any value.\\n \\n \\n3.3\\n \\nCREDIT RISK & RATING DOWNGRADE RISK\\n \\n \\nThe Rating Agency has assigned the credit ratings to the Debentures. In the event of deterioration in \\nthe financial health of the Issuer, there is a possibility that the \\nRating Agency \\nmay downgrad\\ne the \\nrating of the Debentures. In such cases, potential Investors may incur losses on revaluation of their \\ninvestment or make provisions towards sub\\n-\\nstandard/ non\\n-\\nperforming investment as per their usual \\nnorms. \\n \\n \\n3.4\\n \\nCHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY AFFECT THE \\nPRICE OF DEBENTURES.\\n \\n \\nAll securities where a fixed rate of interest is offered, such as this Issue, are subject to price risk. \\nThe price of such securities will vary inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates, i.e. when \\ninterest rates rise, prices\\n \\nof fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices \\nincrease. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity \\nand the increase or decrease in the level of prevailing interest rates.

Potential Investors are \\nurged to consult with their own accounting advisors to determine implications of this investment.\\n \\n \\n3.7\\n \\nSECURITY MAYBE INSUFFICIENT TO REDEEM THE DEBENTURES \\n \\n \\nIn the eve\\nnt that the Company is unable to meet its payment and other obligations towards Investors \\nunder the terms of the Debentures, the Debenture Trustee may enforce the Security as per the terms \\n\\nrecovery in relation to the \\nDebentures will be subject to (i) the market value of such secured property, (ii) finding willing \\nbuyers for the Security at a price sufficient to repay the potential Investors amounts outstanding \\nunder the Debentures. The value\\n \\nrealised from the enforcement of the Security may be insufficient \\nto redeem the Debentures.\\n \\n \\n3.8\\n \\nMATERIAL CHANGES IN REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE ISSUER IS \\n\\nOTHER OBLIGATIONS.\\n \\n \\nThe Issuer is subject gene\\nrally to changes in Indian law, as well as to changes in government \\nregulations and policies and accounting principles. Any changes in the regulatory framework could \\nadversely affect the profitability of the Issuer or its future financial performance, by r\\nequiring a \\nrestructuring of its activities, increasing costs or otherwise.\\n \\n \\n3.9\\n \\nLEGALITY OF PURCHASE\\n \\n \\nPotential Investors \\nof\\n \\nthe Debentures will be responsible for the lawfulness of the acquisition of the \\nDebentures, whether under the laws of the jurisdiction of \\nits \\nincorporation or the jurisdiction in \\nwhich they operate or for compliance by that potential Investor with any law\\n, regulation or \\nregulatory policy applicable to it.\\n \\n \\n3.10\\n \\nPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK IN INDIA\\n \\n \\nThe Issuer operates only within India and, accordingly, all of its revenues are derived from the \\ndomestic market. As a result, it is highly dependent on prevailing e\\nconomic conditions in India and \\nits results of operations are significantly affected by factors influencing the Indian economy. An \\nuncertain economic situation, in India and globally, could result in a further slowdown in economic \\ngrowth, investment and co\\nnsumption. A slowdown in the rate of growth in the Indian economy \\ncould result in lower demand for credit and other financial products and services and higher \\ndefaults. Any slowdown in the growth or negative growth of sectors where the Issuer has a \\nrelativ\\nely higher exposure could adversely impact its performance. Any such slowdown could \\nadversely affect its business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\\n \\n \\nRISKS RELATED TO THE BUSINESS OF THE ISSUER\\n \\n \\nInformation Memorandum\\n \\n \\n    \\n \\nPrivate & Confidential\\n \\nDate: \\nJanuary 22, 2021\\n \\n \\n \\nFor Private Circulation Only\\n \\n \\n(This Information Memorandum is neither a prospectus nor a statement in lieu of a prospectus)\\n \\n \\n12\\n \\n \\n(a)\\n \\n \\n\\nclients of these loans are of the high\\n-\\nrisk category and if the Issuer is unable to control \\nthe level of non\\n-\\n\\ns loan loss \\nreserves are insufficient to cover future loan losses, the financial condition and results of \\noperations may be materially and adversely affected.\\n \\n\\nclients\\n \\nof these loans are of the high\\n-\\n\\nability to fulfil its loan obligations Such non\\n-\\nperforming or low credit quality loans can \\nnegatively impact our results of operations.\\n \\n \\nThe Issuer has various procedures a\\nnd process controls in place to mitigate the risk. \\n \\n \\nAs on March 31, 2020, the gross NPA was 24.22 crores on a gross portfolio of Rs.1300.67\\n \\ncrores\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Issuer cannot assure that the Issuer will be able to effectively control and reduce the \\nlevel of the\\n \\n\\nnon\\n-\\nperforming loans may increase in the future as a result of growth in the total loan \\n\\n-\\nextended \\nm\\nember credit that we are unaware of.

The Issuer \\nrequires certain approvals, licenses, registrations and permissions for operating its business, \\nincluding registration with the RBI as a NBFC pursuant to Section 45\\n-\\nIA o\\nf the RBI Act, \\n1934. Further, such approvals, licenses, registrations and permissions must be \\nmaintained/renewed over time, applicable requirements may change, and the Issuer may \\nnot be aware of or comply with all requirements all of the time. Additionally\\n, RBI has \\nissued detailed directions on prudential norms \\ninter alia\\n \\nprescribing guidelines on income \\nrecognition, asset classification and provisioning requirements applicable to NBFCs, \\nexposure norms, disclosures in the balance sheet, requirement of capit\\nal adequacy, \\nrestrictions on investments in land and building and unquoted shares besides others. In \\nparticular, the Issuer is required to obtain a certificate of registration for carrying on \\nbusiness as a NBFC\\n-\\nND that is subject to numerous conditions. In\\n \\naddition, its branches are \\nrequired to be registered under the relevant shops and establishments laws of the states in \\nwhich they are located. The shops and establishments laws regulate various employment \\nconditions, including working hours, holidays and \\nleave and overtime compensation. If the \\nIssuer fails to obtain or retain any of these approvals or licenses, or renewals thereof, in a \\ntimely manner, or at all, its business may be adversely affected. If the Issuer fails to \\ncomply, or a regulator claims th\\nat it has not complied, with any of these conditions, the \\n\\ncarry on such activities. If the Issuer fails to comply with the NBFC Directions and fails to \\nmaintain\\n \\nthe status of NBFC it may attract penal provisions under the RBI Act, 1934 for \\nnon\\n-\\ncompliance. The penal action can also result in RBI cancelling the Certificate of \\nRegistration issued to the NBFC.\\n \\n \\n(e)\\n \\nIssuer may be required to increase capital ratio or amou\\nnt of loan loss reserves, which \\nmay result in changes to business and accounting practices that would harm business \\nand results of operations.\\n \\n \\nThe Issuer is subject to the RBI minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio regulations. \\nPursuant to Section 45\\n\\nIC of the RBI Act, 1934 every NBFC is required to create a reserve \\nfund and transfer thereto a sum not less than 20.0% of its net profit ever\\ny year, as disclosed \\nin the profit and loss account and before any dividend is declared. The Issuer is also \\nrequired to maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 15.0% in relation to aggregate \\nrisk\\n-\\nweighted assets and risk adjusted assigned loans. \\n \\n \\nThe\\n \\nRBI may also in the future require compliance with other financial ratios and \\nstandards.

Potential Investors should carefully consider all the risk factors in this Information Memorandum and/or the Private Placement Offer cum Application Letter for evaluating the Company and its business and the Debentures before making any investment decision relating to the Debentures. The Company believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the Debentures but does not represent that the statements below regarding risks of holding the Debentures are exhaustive. The ordering of the risk factors is intended to facilitate ease of reading and reference and does not in any manner indicate the importance of one risk factor over another. Potential Investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Information Memorandum and/or the Private Placement Offer cum Application Letter and reach their own views prior to making any investment decision.  3.1 REPAYMENT IS SUBJECT TO THE CREDIT RISK OF THE ISSUER.  Potential investors (\"Investors\") should be aware that receipt of the principal amount, (i.e. the redemption amount) and any other amounts that may be due in respect of the Debentures (as defined below) is subject to the credit risk of the Issuer. Potential Investors assume the risk that the Issuer will not be able to satisfy their obligations under the Debentures. In the event that bankruptcy proceedings or composition, scheme of arrangement or similar proceedings to avert bankruptcy are instituted by or against the Issuer, the payment of sums due on the Debentures may not be made or may be substantially reduced or delayed.  3.2 THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR DEBENTURES MAY BE ILLIQUID.  The Debentures may be very illiquid and no secondary market may develop in respect thereof. Even if there is a secondary market for the Debentures, it is not likely to provide significant liquidity. Potential Investors may have to hold the Debentures until redemption to realize any value.  3.3 CREDIT RISK & RATING DOWNGRADE RISK  The Rating Agency has assigned the credit ratings to the Debentures. In the event of deterioration in the financial health of the Issuer, there is a possibility that the Rating Agency may downgrade the rating of the Debentures. In such cases, potential Investors may incur losses on revaluation of their investment or make provisions towards sub-standard/ non-performing investment as per their usual norms.   3.4 CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY AFFECT THE PRICE OF DEBENTURES.  All securities where a fixed rate of interest is offered, such as this Issue, are subject to price risk. The price of such securities will vary inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates, i.e. when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of prevailing interest rates. Increased rates of interest, Information Memorandum       Private & Confidential Date: January 22, 2021   For Private Circulation Only  (This Information Memorandum is neither a prospectus nor a statement in lieu of a prospectus)  11  which frequently accompany inflation and/or a growing economy, are likely to have a negative effect on the pricing of the Debentures.  3.5 TAX CONSIDERATIONS AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS  Special tax considerations and legal considerations may apply to certain types of investors.

The value realised from the enforcement of the Security may be insufficient to redeem the Debentures.  3.8 MATERIAL CHANGES IN REGULATIONS TO WHICH THE ISSUER IS OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  The Issuer is subject generally to changes in Indian law, as well as to changes in government regulations and policies and accounting principles. Any changes in the regulatory framework could adversely affect the profitability of the Issuer or its future financial performance, by requiring a restructuring of its activities, increasing costs or otherwise.  3.9 LEGALITY OF PURCHASE  Potential Investors of the Debentures will be responsible for the lawfulness of the acquisition of the Debentures, whether under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or the jurisdiction in which they operate or for compliance by that potential Investor with any law, regulation or regulatory policy applicable to it.  3.10 POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK IN INDIA  The Issuer operates only within India and, accordingly, all of its revenues are derived from the domestic market.
