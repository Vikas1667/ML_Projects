    "Predictive Maintenance aims to optimize the balance between corrective and preventive maintenance by enabling just in time replacement of components. This approach minimizes the cost of unscheduled maintenance and maximizes the component's lifespan, thus getting more value out of a part\n",

    "The output you will get is an approximation of time before a failure is expected to happen,\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Classification approach: This predictive approach makes predictions of the possibility of failure in any of the upcoming steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regression approach: This approach makes prediction of the time left before a system is failed. This predicted time before system failure is also called as Remaining Useful Life (RUL).\n",
