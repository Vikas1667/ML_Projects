    "    * You can also build your pipeline without the SDK using the pipeline definition JSON schema. \n",
    "    * This pipeline definition encodes a pipeline using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that can be exported as a JSON             definition.  \n",
    "    * This DAG gives information on the requirements for and relationships between each step of your pipeline. The               structure of a pipeline's DAG is determined by the data dependencies between steps. \n",
    "    * These data dependencies are created when the properties of a step's output are passed as the input to another step.         The following image is an example of a pipeline DAG:\n",

Use these templates to process data, extract features, train and test models, register the models in the SageMaker model registry, and deploy the models for inference.
