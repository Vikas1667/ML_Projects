TImely Promotion if you do shoe police nicely to your manager
Year end Hikes ranging from 10% to 16% average","Stupid merciless/heartless manager who always like to screw resources.
Dumb TL's who dont have power at all. They will never support Resources.They always polish manager's shoes and listen to what he says."
3,Good Company,Recommends,Approves of CEO,I have been working at Accenture full-time for more than 3 years,Good Company. Although it depends on the Project also. Some projects are really busy with lots of work load and some are very chilled out. you will not be asked to stretch or work on weekend until it is very much necessary.,"It has 10 hrs of work timing. Sometimes you feel being a senior employee the work that you are doing is not upto your level. any new comer can also work on your belalf. Although they have an extensive learning portal but learning on project level is quite less sometimes when you are the only resource working in the project in your Technology.

Also, there interview process is not very transparent. Some people dont even get jobs even after clearing all the rounds they are put on hold and no body knows what is the status of your hiring.

Simillarly there internal processes are not transparent you never know when you will be pulled out of the project for a different work and you will not be able to provide your opinion in your hiring or your interest and your experience."
4,Working environment,Recommends,Positive Outlook,I have been working at Accenture full-time for more than 3 years,"If you are looking for a career in IT services it’s one of those companies to start with however, down the years you might not get what you are expecting so its definitely smart to switch within a year or two.
Its an enterprise where there are many employees so that lower strata of employees never feel much job pressure. But again it's not the place for passionate workers.
Accenture provides you opportunities to learn and get trained in a technology you might feel confident about but it doesn't guarantee you projects on that particular technology always.
at the end , the above points are purely my personal view that I felt in my tenure in Accenture.","There are no cons as such. I found Accenture experience totally subjected to an employee’s nature. If you are introvert and don’t ask for work proactively, you might feel like a tiny fish in a vast ocean, and probably become an unidentified robo in the crowd.

On the other hand, if you are proactive enough to take up any work, asking for more, showing enthusiasm in extra activities, you will end up gaining good visibility that will help rocketing your growth up in Accenture.

Also, Accenture provides free certifications time to time to upskill employees, and in case one gets into a niche skill, bonus is provided.

Other than that if you compare the salary part wih any other service company, you won’t be disappointed, but once compared with other leading product companies, it’s disheartening. And that can be considered as a ‘con’."
5,Best company to work for but,Recommends,Neutral Outlook,I have been working at Accenture full-time,"We get very good salary hikes and bonus
Good work environment","Few projects are worst with bad politics.

My Italy manager have very good impression on me and it was told to my TL by her. But he never interested to tell the same to my Indian manager.

You need to get out of company just because you cannot take politics any more and also too much politics played in the team to get promotion.

Too much favoritism. 

Promotion preference is given to those who are close to TLs, only then the remaining people will be considered to give promotion.

For example: My TL's best friend got promoted first then the other guy in my team got promoted in the next cycle that too he is having more experience than my TL's best friend.

TLs will intentionally give appreciation mails to those who are favorite to them.

Very cheap trick played by TLs.

TLs create many reasons to scold you infront of managers."
6,Good for freshers,Recommends,Positive Outlook,I have been working at Accenture full-time,"Good for freshers.
Accenture doesnot just remove people in bench.
Many internal trainings available.","Too much of discrimination against BCA graduates.
Mechanical Engineering graduates who join as freshers and have no idea about computer programming and software are paid more than BCA graduates with 2 years of experience.
Also they have a bigger share on variable pay , market correction , hike, promotion .

BCA is a three year degree and engineering is 4 year degree.
BCA involves everything purely about computer software hardware development etc, whereas people from automobile, mechanical etc who are not that well versed with computers are paid a lot more everytime, just coz of an engineering degree that too an irrelevant one."
7,Appraisal system is slowing down the company,Doesn't Recommend,No Opinion of CEO,I worked at Accenture full-time for more than 8 years,"1)lots of things to learn at management level. Especially on presentation skills and building relationships with clients 
2) There is a growth path as people at every level are constantly being fired
3) salary is good at senior levels","1) Appraisal system is very bad at times you have to remove 15% of folks.plus there are restrictions on whom you can put at that level women can’t be given the bad ratings plus you have to keep women in the team, this means sometimes the percentage of bottom cases moves to 40%.The entire year the year end appraisal keeps playing on the head and employees work in fear . Hence many times not taking risks
2) people at manager and above level are not doing a lot of technical work. It’s mostly client handling, showcasing work within Accenture a, managing resources and escalations
3) At times people are working more for Accenture internal leadership than the client"

Promotion preference is given to those who are close to TLs, only then the remaining people will be considered to give promotion.

For example: My TL's best friend got promoted first then the other guy in my team got promoted in the next cycle that too he is having more experience than my TL's best friend.

TLs will intentionally give appreciation mails to those who are favorite to them.

Accenture doesnot just remove people in bench.
Many internal trainings available.","Too much of discrimination against BCA graduates.
Mechanical Engineering graduates who join as freshers and have no idea about computer programming and software are paid more than BCA graduates with 2 years of experience.
Also they have a bigger share on variable pay , market correction , hike, promotion .

BCA is a three year degree and engineering is 4 year degree.
BCA involves everything purely about computer software hardware development etc, whereas people from automobile, mechanical etc who are not that well versed with computers are paid a lot more everytime, just coz of an engineering degree that too an irrelevant one."

Hence many times not taking risks

Sometimes you feel being a senior employee the work that you are doing is not upto your level. any new comer can also work on your belalf. Although they have an extensive learning portal but learning on project level is quite less sometimes when you are the only resource working in the project in your Technology.

Also, there interview process is not very transparent. Some people dont even get jobs even after clearing all the rounds they are put on hold and no body knows what is the status of your hiring.

On the other hand, if you are proactive enough to take up any work, asking for more, showing enthusiasm in extra activities, you will end up gaining good visibility that will help rocketing your growth up in Accenture.

Also, Accenture provides free certifications time to time to upskill employees, and in case one gets into a niche skill, bonus is provided.

Other than that if you compare the salary part wih any other service company, you won’t be disappointed, but once compared with other leading product companies, it’s disheartening. And that can be considered as a ‘con’."
