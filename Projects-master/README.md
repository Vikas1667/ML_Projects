## Lung Cancer Detection Using Fuzzy logic and CNN 
Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers.
The American Cancer Societyâ€™s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:
About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)
About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)
CT scan images is been used for processing.In preprocessing, segementation is important step to reduce computational time as well as space.In segmentation, lungs to be extracted from alonside parts like ribs,air,etc which can be precisely because if it is not done there is chances of loosing important data.   

## Text Classification 
AG's News Topic Classification Dataset
Version 3, Updated 09/09/2015
ORIGIN
AG is a collection of more than 1 million news articles.News articles have been gathered from more than 2000 news sources by ComeToMyHead in more than 1 year of activity. ComeToMyHead is an academic news search engine which has been running since July, 2004. The dataset is provided by the academic comunity for research purposes in data mining (clustering, classification, etc), information retrieval (ranking, search, etc), xml, data compression, data streaming, and any other non-commercial activity. For more information, please refer to the link http://www.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html . The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the dataset above. It is used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

#### DESCRIPTION
The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed by choosing 4 largest classes from the original corpus. Each class contains 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples. The total number of training samples is 120,000 and testing 7,600.

The file classes.txt contains a list of classes corresponding to each label. The files train.csv and test.csv contain all the training samples as comma-sparated values. There are 3 columns in them, corresponding to class index (1 to 4), title and description. The title and description are escaped using double quotes ("), and any internal double quote is escaped by 2 double quotes (""). New lines are escaped by a backslash followed with an "n" character, that is "\n".

## Twitter API 
All the large, well-known social networks and hundreds of international companies generate business thanks to the REST system (Representational State System), and Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook, were not going to be left behind.

As mentioned at the beginning, the Twitter API, like those of other social networks, allows reading user profiles and publications in the social network, as well as generating tweets.

Starting with this last option, which may be easier to understand, a basic use of the Twitter API in your company could be creating and publishing tweets after the occurrence of X requirements, so that whenever a series of circumstances took place, your company's profile would send out a corresponding tweet. For example, each time someone names your company in Twitter and includes the words "query", "question", please" or "thank you", you can create a default thank you tweet with your company's maximum response time. Any bot in Twitter or profiles that publish automatic tweets normally uses the streaming Twitter API, based on an app created in this social network. There are thousands of entertaining cases of bots in Twitter, in fact, according to a recent study, 15% of Twitter users are bots.

The use of Twitter is based on accessing user profiles and publications in this social network, so we can create user patterns for our business or find out their degree of experience satisfaction.
