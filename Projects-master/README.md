## Lung Cancer Detection Using Fuzzy logic and CNN 
Lung cancer (both small cell and non-small cell) is the second most common cancer in both men and women (not counting skin cancer). In men, prostate cancer is more common, while in women breast cancer is more common. About 14% of all new cancers are lung cancers.
The American Cancer Societyâ€™s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are:
About 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women)
About 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women)
CT scan images is been used for processing.In preprocessing, segementation is important step to reduce computational time as well as space.In segmentation, lungs to be extracted from alonside parts like ribs,air,etc which can be precisely because if it is not done there is chances of loosing important data.   

## Text Classification 
AG's News Topic Classification Dataset
Version 3, Updated 09/09/2015
ORIGIN
AG is a collection of more than 1 million news articles.News articles have been gathered from more than 2000 news sources by ComeToMyHead in more than 1 year of activity. ComeToMyHead is an academic news search engine which has been running since July, 2004. The dataset is provided by the academic comunity for research purposes in data mining (clustering, classification, etc), information retrieval (ranking, search, etc), xml, data compression, data streaming, and any other non-commercial activity. For more information, please refer to the link http://www.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html . The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed by Xiang Zhang (xiang.zhang@nyu.edu) from the dataset above. It is used as a text classification benchmark in the following paper: Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015).

#### DESCRIPTION
The AG's news topic classification dataset is constructed by choosing 4 largest classes from the original corpus. Each class contains 30,000 training samples and 1,900 testing samples. The total number of training samples is 120,000 and testing 7,600.

The file classes.txt contains a list of classes corresponding to each label. The files train.csv and test.csv contain all the training samples as comma-sparated values. There are 3 columns in them, corresponding to class index (1 to 4), title and description. The title and description are escaped using double quotes ("), and any internal double quote is escaped by 2 double quotes (""). New lines are escaped by a backslash followed with an "n" character, that is "\n".

## Image classification and Segmentation
Bacterial strips often required to segment before feeding deep learning models for computation, so accurate segmentation is vital part is evaluated 
selfie image is been required to identify from various sources and its trained using CNN.

Oxford Dictionary: Selfie is a photograph that one has taken of
oneself, typically one taken with a smartphone or webcam and shared
via social media.
How Big is the Selfie Phenomenon? Google recently reported
that there are about 93 millions of selfies taken every day only on
Android devices!
Research Questions:
1. How do different attributes, such as gender, race or hair color,
influence the popularity of selfies?
2. How does the appearance of certain objects or particular
concepts affect the popularity of selfies?
3. Is there a relationship between the sentiment inferred from a
selfie and its popularity?
4. How does post-processing, such as applying different Instagram
filters, influence the popularity of selfies?


## Drone Path for Getting aerial images for Survelience

Drone for Aerial Intelligence is widely used recently for various applications

#### Description
We have a video that we've shot over their site, as well as a set of aerial images. We would like to show them a POC level
app where they can watch the video, and whenever they pause the video to inspect
anything, we will be able to show them the images taken at that point. It will 
add great value to our entire offering.
